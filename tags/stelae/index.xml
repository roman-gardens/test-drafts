Garden Tomb garden of A. Coelius C. f.
Keywords tombs epitaphs stelae mausoleums Garden Description A broken marble slab immured in the cathedral at Padua since the seventeenth century records the epitaph of A. Coelius C. f., who some time in the first or second century dedicated to the divine spirits (Dis Manibus) and to himself in perpetuity a garden that had once, it seems, belonged to an Arius (hortum… Arianum). Whether it had always been a tomb garden or was only then being converted to a funerary use is uncertain.

Garden Tomb Garden of L. Ogius Patroclus
Keywords tombs epitaphs stelae grove (sacred grove) vegetable gardens Garden Description A marble slab reported at Altinum in the sixteenth century and now in Venice records, above a depiction of an axe, a plumb-line, and a tree with birds, the epitaph of L. Ogius Patroclus, who some time (probably) in the late first or second century, “following the tradition of dutiful respect maintained by the corporation of firemen, donated while still living the gardens with building adjoining the tomb, so that from their revenue roses and food would be supplied generously for his patron and, eventually, for himself” (secutus pietatem col(legii) cent(onariorum) hortos cum aedificio huic sepult(urae) {a} iunctos vivos donavit, ut ex reditu eor(um) largius rosae et esce patrono suo et quandoque sibi ponerentur). The pairing of roses for the dead and food for the living (rosae et escae) was common in Roman funerary celebrations at the grave site, which perhaps suggests that mixed planting of flowers and vegetables was common in Roman tomb gardens as well (cf. ILS 6711, 8371).

Garden Tomb garden of T. Vettius Hermes
Keywords tombs epitaphs stelae Garden Description A marble stele now in a church at Grazzano records the epitaph of T. Vettius Hermes, a freedman ointment dealer (seplasiarius). After a gnomic sentiment about chthonic birthand reunion (mater genuit materq(ue) recepiit), Hermes goes on to declare that “these gardens, as great and excellent as they are, (will) serve my ashes, for I shall appoint caretakers to dine on the proceeds from them on my birthday and on the day of roses, in perpetuity” (hi horti ita uti o(ptimi) m(aximi)/que sunt cineribus seruite(!) meis nam curatores substituam uti uescantur ex horum hortorum reditu natale meo et per rosam in perpetuo).

Garden Funerary Grove of Q. Cervonius Chryseros
Keywords tombs stelae grove (sacred grove) altars (religious fixtures) Garden Description A small inscribed altar of (probably) the Julio-Claudian era found by Mommsen among the stones of Aquileia and now lost records on its left and right sides dedications to Dis Pater and (H)era respectively and, on its front, the name of the dedicant, a consul’s aide (acc(ensus) co(n)s(ularis)) and local sevir at Florentia, Q. Cervonius Chryseros, who built “the grove, the enclosure wall, the altars, the mound (? molem), and the seats” (lucum, maceriem, aras, molem, [s]edilia). The dedication to Dis Pater suggests a funerary context, which leads Chioffi to identify the molis as a tomb monument of some ill-defined type (perhaps an irregular mound?). A Roman soldier serving in lower Germany at Carvium (Herwen) was buried by his two heirs ad molem, “near (or at) the mound” (AE 1939, 130). The same Chryseros perhaps appears as the owner of a slave, Fausta, who in fulfillment of a vow dedicated another monument to Dis Pater at Aquileia (CIL 5.35*).
