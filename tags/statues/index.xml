&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.digitalaugustanrome.org/records/mausoleum-augustus">Mausoleum of Augustus&lt;/a> was located in the northern &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_Martius">&lt;em>Campus Martius&lt;/em>&lt;/a> between the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Flaminia">&lt;em>Via Flaminia&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>. The exact bounds of the park are unknown, but they stretched from north of the Mausoleum of Augustus to south of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300404895">&lt;em>Horologium&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis">Ara Pacis&lt;/a>, which was located along the &lt;em>Via Flaminia&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>&lt;em>Mausoleum Augusti&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>Between 28 and 23 BCE, the emperor &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus&lt;/a> erected his Mausoleum in the northern &lt;em>Campus Martius&lt;/em> within a public park composed of trees (&lt;em>silvae&lt;/em>) and walks (&lt;em>ambulationes&lt;/em>) (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.3.8">Strabo 5.3.8&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo012.perseus-lat1:100">Suet. Aug. 100&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/SuetTib">Trans.&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0385.tlg001.perseus-grc1:53.30">Cassius Dio 53.30.5&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/CDioE53">Trans.&lt;/a>). Excavations of the Mausoleum were carried out in 1869, 1871–1872, 1907–1908, 1916–1930 and 1934–1938. During the excavations conducted under Mussolini (1934–1938), all post-antique structures associated with the Mausoleum were removed. These excavations did not reveal additional information about the plantings and nature of the summit of the Mausoleum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reconstructions of the Mausoleum vary with regard to the depiction of the trees and summit of the mound. According to &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.3.8">Strabo (5.3.8)&lt;/a>, evergreen trees (&lt;em>ἀειθᾶλής&lt;/em>) were thickly planted on the vault of the Mausoleum up to the summit, where a bronze &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statue&lt;/a> of Augustus stood. Most reconstructions place &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupressus_sempervirens">Italian cypresses&lt;/a> (&lt;em>Cupressus sempervirens&lt;/em>) atop the structure, and cypresses are planted on the remains of the Mausoleum today. L. Richardson rejected this idea in favor of smaller trees, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupressus_sempervirens">junipers&lt;/a> (&lt;em>Juniperis communis&lt;/em>), on the basis of the structural damage that the cypress roots would have caused. However, Romans routinely manipulated trees and plants in an art form known as &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300061887">&lt;em>ars topiaria&lt;/em>&lt;/a>; therefore, ancient gardening techniques would have permitted the cypresses to be dwarfed and adapted for this type of planting (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:16.29">Plin. &lt;em>HN&lt;/em> 16.139–42&lt;/a>). Moreover, cypress trees were often planted in funerary contexts, making them a suitable choice for the Mausoleum (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:16.29">Plin. &lt;em>HN&lt;/em> 16.139–40&lt;/a>). Without additional evidence, however, it is impossible to confirm which type of evergreen was planted upon the funereal mound. Some reconstructions place a circular &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002613">colonnade&lt;/a> on the summit as a base for the statue. While there is no mention of such a structure in the ancient sources, the statue must have been placed on some sort of elevated mound in order to be visible above the trees, since the Mausoleum was visible from the Tiber (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.3.8">Strabo 5.3.8&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi005.perseus-lat1:3.9">Tacitus &lt;em>Ann.&lt;/em> 3.9&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>&lt;em>Silvae et Ambulationes&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>Surrounding the Mausoleum were trees (&lt;em>silvae&lt;/em>) and walks (&lt;em>ambulationes&lt;/em>). &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo">Strabo&lt;/a> referred to this region as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_precinct">precinct&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008884">grove&lt;/a> (&lt;em>ἄλσος&lt;/em>) with pleasant walks (&lt;em>περίπᾰτος&lt;/em>). Bounded by the Tiber and the &lt;em>Via Flaminia&lt;/em>, the park was open to the public in 28 BCE (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo012.perseus-lat1:99">Suet. Aug. 100&lt;/a>). No archaeological excavations illuminate the layout of these walks or the trees planted. These gardens also held many &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300003725">altars&lt;/a>, including the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis">Ara Pacis&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>&lt;em>Horologium Augusti&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>Between 13 and 9 BCE Augustus initiated the building of the Ara Pacis; during the same period, he also erected the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalaugustanrome.org/records/horologium-augusti">&lt;em>Horologium Augusti&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, a sundial. The Mausoleum and its grove were connected to the rest of Augustus’s park by the &lt;em>Horologium&lt;/em>. Begun in 10 BCE and dedicated in 9 BCE, the sundial was a celebration of Augustus’s Egyptian victory. The red &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011183">granite&lt;/a> Egyptian &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300007021">obelisk&lt;/a> (30 m. H.), known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk_of_Montecitorio">&lt;em>Montecitorio Obelisk&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, was brought as booty from Egypt by Augustus. It served as the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300197553">&lt;em>gnomon&lt;/em>&lt;/a> for the sundial, casting its shadow on the monumental &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011329">travertine&lt;/a> plaza inlaid with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300010957">bronze&lt;/a> notations. Novius Facundus designed the &lt;em>Horologium&lt;/em> and modified the obelisk to have a rounded globe at its peak in order to cast precise shadows (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:16.29">Pliny HN 36.72–76&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1976, E. Bucher proposed that the &lt;em>gnomon&lt;/em> cast a 150 m. shadow directly across the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300003725">altar&lt;/a> of the &lt;a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanurbs/arapacis.html">Ara Pacis&lt;/a> on September 23, Augustus’s birthday. In the cellar floor of no. 48 &lt;em>Via di Campo&lt;/em>, he uncovered what he believed to be part of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial#Meridian_lines">Meridian line&lt;/a> of the sundial (although the phase he discovered dated to the Flavian era) with cross bars and signs of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac">zodiac&lt;/a> in Greek, showing how the sundial worked as a calendar and wind index. Using digital reconstructions with shadow and light simulations in combination with further archival work and archaeological coring in the &lt;em>Campus Martius&lt;/em>, a team of scholars working under the direction of B. Frischer has demonstrated that, in fact, there were many solar and shadow alignments between the obelisk and the Ara Pacis (on 238 days of the year). These alignments would have played into Augustan themes of peace, family, stability, and fertility, as well as the triumphal victory over Egypt.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>&lt;em>Ara Pacis Augustae&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.digitalaugustanrome.org/records/pax-augusta-ara">Ara Pacis&lt;/a> is the most famous piece of Augustan monumental &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047090">sculpture&lt;/a> in Rome. Dedicated in 9 BCE on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livia">Livia’s&lt;/a> birthday, the Altar of Peace was a celebration of Augustus’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Romana">&lt;em>Pax Romana&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. Located adjacent to the &lt;em>Via Flaminia&lt;/em>, there is no specific evidence for its park setting; however, the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047230">sculptural reliefs&lt;/a>, especially the vegetation depicted in the lower register of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011443">marble&lt;/a> wall that encloses the altar, contributed to the overall themes of the Augustan campus that celebrated fertility, family, and peace, among other themes. It was reconstructed in 1938 from fragments, after which Mussolini moved it from its original location, just west of the &lt;em>Via Flaminia&lt;/em>, and placed it next to the Mausoleum of Augustus.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>&lt;em>Ustrinum&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- -->
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo">Strabo&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.3.8">(5.3.8)&lt;/a> also described Augustus’s funeral &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005876">&lt;em>καῦστρα&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (or crematorium), which scholars traditionally called the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalaugustanrome.org/records/ustrinum-domus-augustae/">&lt;em>ustrinum&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, as enclosed by white marble walls surrounded by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_nigra">black poplars&lt;/a> (&lt;em>Populus nigra&lt;/em> / &lt;em>αἴγειρος&lt;/em>) and then by a circular &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011002">iron&lt;/a> fence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Six large travertine slabs with inscriptions that refer to different members of the imperial household were discovered in 1777 in the area of Piazza S. Carlo al Corso, near the Mausoleum of Augustus (&lt;a href="https://cil.bbaw.de/hauptnavigation/das-cil/baende">CIL VI 888–93&lt;/a>). Three of these stones— interpreted either as &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002712">orthostat&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006963">cippi&lt;/a>&lt;/em> or as paving stones— are inscribed with the phrase HIC CREMATVS EST. Based on these inscriptions, scholars assumed that this was the &lt;em>ustrinum&lt;/em> described by Strabo where Augustus’s body was cremated in 14 CE. V. Jolivet has since demonstrated otherwise. In 1937, remains from the 2nd C CE were unearthed, demonstrating that the circular structure described by Strabo is, in fact, too far north to be in the middle of the plain as he described it. The cremations of other important Julio-Claudians, including the three children of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanicus">Germanicus&lt;/a> who died as infants during the reign of Augustus, and the elder brother of the future emperor &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Gaius&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo014.perseus-lat1:7.1">Suet., &lt;em>Calig.&lt;/em> 7.1&lt;/a>,&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.abo014.perseus-lat1:8.2">8.2&lt;/a>), were commemorated here. While these remains are post-Augustan in date, they are associated with the cremation of members of the imperial household- which underscores the imperial overtones of this part of the &lt;em>Campus Martius&lt;/em>. The location of Augustus’s funeral &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyre">pyre&lt;/a> remains unknown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The park in which the Mausoleum of Augustus, the Ara Pacis, the Horologium, and several other altars were located, transformed the entire northern &lt;em>Campus Martius&lt;/em> into a celebration of Augustus’s life, achievements, and death.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="location-description">Location Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia Antica&lt;/a>, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostium#Latin">&lt;em>ostium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>, where it flowed into the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1112319">Tyrrhenian sea&lt;/a>. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> century by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius">king Ancus Marcius&lt;/a>; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a &lt;em>colonia maritima&lt;/em> in the 4&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> century BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3&lt;sup>rd&lt;/sup> century BCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the 2&lt;sup>nd&lt;/sup> century BCE Ostia (and later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus">Portus&lt;/a>) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century BCE. They were &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_bucrania/">House of the Bucrania&lt;/a>). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_on_via_del_tempio_rotondo/">House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo&lt;/a>, which dates to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustan period&lt;/a>, the one found below the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/schola_of_trajan/">Schola of Trajan&lt;/a> (built 20-40 CE) and the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_thunderbolt/">House of the Thunderbolt&lt;/a>, datable to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian">Vespasianic period&lt;/a> (69-79 CE). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_fortuna_annonaria/">House of Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/a>, with its garden (140-190 CE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2&lt;sup>nd&lt;/sup> century CE, under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">&lt;em>insula&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the façade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian">Hadrianic period&lt;/a>, for example in some &lt;em>insulae&lt;/em> that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/insula_dei_dipinti/">Insula of the Paintings&lt;/a>, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its façade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3&lt;sup>rd&lt;/sup> and 4&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> centuries, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_of_amor_and_psyche/">House of Amor and Psyche&lt;/a>), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.stoa.org/hippo/text9.html#TB9C10S23">&lt;em>Confessions&lt;/em> 9.10.23&lt;/a>), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monica">St. Monica&lt;/a> in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1&lt;sup>st&lt;/sup>-3&lt;sup>rd&lt;/sup> century CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> century CE “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (&lt;em>Cosmographia&lt;/em>: 25.25-30).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The area in which these houses are situated was laid out as a residential area in &lt;em>c&lt;/em>. 128 CE as part of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian">Hadrianic&lt;/a> remodeling of Ostia (Fig. 1). It is delimited by buildings of various depths, due to the irregularity of the available space. The central area is occupied by two blocks each comprising four houses, surrounded, according to the excavators, by a garden furnished with six &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountains&lt;/a> (a) (three on the west and three on the east side; they each measure 2.93x3.55 m. and have a maximum preserved height of 75 cm.) (Figs. 2, 3). The fountains had more than a purely decorative function. They seem rather to be the classic type of canopied fountain. Each was equipped with a water spout and probably with an opening for drawing water. The fountains were surrounded on three sides by a travertine border, in which a little channel for the discharge of excess water was hewn. Two rounded grooves in the channel, in front of each spout, have been interpreted as supports for vessels to rest in as they were filled with water. On the fourth side, which has no border, is an outlet for the discharge of water, which flowed into the main drain leading outside the complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fourth fountain (b) was added on the eastern side, in the early years of the 3rd century CE. Its floor was embellished with a mosaic representing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile">Nilotic&lt;/a> scenes (3.30x2.96 m) (Fig. 4); it has been suggested that it was roofed with a pergola supported by small columns. This fountain was essentially ornamental. It would have provided &lt;em>jeux d’eau&lt;/em> and was perhaps combined with small flower-beds or garden sculptures in the area surrounded by the mosaic border.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A sculptural group with a fishing scene, which could be interpreted as a fountain-head, was found (not &lt;em>in situ&lt;/em>) in one of the rooms of the eastern block and might have belonged to this fountain (Fig. 5).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia Antica&lt;/a>, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostium#Latin">&lt;em>ostium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>, where it flowed into the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1112319">Tyrrhenian sea&lt;/a>. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> century by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius">king Ancus Marcius&lt;/a>; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a &lt;em>colonia maritima&lt;/em> in the 4&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> century BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3&lt;sup>rd&lt;/sup> century BCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the 2&lt;sup>nd&lt;/sup> century BCE Ostia (and later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus">Portus&lt;/a>) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the original plan of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300020543">Augustan&lt;/a> period the garden area to the back of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300007117">theater&lt;/a> was surrounded on three sides by a roofed corridor opening onto the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a> on the northern side with a monumental entrance. In the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300020545">Claudian&lt;/a> period the whole level of the area was raised and a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> consisting of a single row of brick &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> added. A temple was built at the center of the garden area in the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/ulan/500083758">Domitianic&lt;/a> period; traditionally identified since its discovery (1881) with the temple of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(mythology)">Ceres&lt;/a>, it has more recently been attributed to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_(mythology)">Vulcan&lt;/a> or to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_cult_of_ancient_Rome">imperial cult&lt;/a>. During the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300107350">Hadrianic&lt;/a> period the portico was doubled with a second row of columns; the entrances on the northern side were blocked, and buildings erected against them, making access to the garden possible only from the theater (Fig. 1).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The open area to the back of the theater was never built over. Laid out as a garden, and adorned with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statues&lt;/a> raised in honor of men who had distinguished themselves in trade, it conformed to the recommendation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">Vitruvius&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-lat1:5.9.1">5.9.1&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-eng1:5.9.1">(English)&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-lat1:5.9.5">5.9.5&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1056.phi001.perseus-eng1:5.9.5">(English)&lt;/a>), that areas surrounding a theater be laid out with colonnades (&lt;em>post scaenam porticus&lt;/em>) and embellished with gardens, where people could stroll about and converse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the excavations of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodolfo_Lanciani">Rodolfo Lanciani&lt;/a> (1881) “a street traversing the excavated area of the Forum and aligned on the axis of the temple and the theatre” was identified (Fig. 2). Reported to be “gravelled and edged with marble borders”, this street was probably a path of the garden that led from the theater to the temple at the center of the area: “The Forum of Ceres ... was once ornamented with a garden, the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300178561">&lt;em>allées&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of which can still be traced with the help of the marble border-lines by which each plot of green was defined and surrounded.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the excavations of &lt;a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vaglieri">Dante Vaglieri&lt;/a> (1910-1913), a system of conduits was identified. It was linked to a large &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006122">sewer&lt;/a> that ran underground at the center of the garden area, sloping downwards from south to north in the direction of the Tiber (Fig. 3). Two conduits parallel to the central sewer ran in front of the &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/statio#Latin">&lt;em>stationes&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. At garden level there were two long gutters that collected rainwater from the roof of the portico. Two basins (respectively 3.10x2.90 and 3.45x3.35 m) at ground level were identified on the southern side of the garden; they were paved with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300379969">&lt;em>opus signinum&lt;/em>&lt;/a> on the inside and probably panelled in marble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In October 1912 Dante Vaglieri began the reconstruction of the garden at the center of the Piazzale delle Corporazioni (Fig. 4). He commissioned a famous landscape architect of the period to create a garden with rectangular &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300184573">parterres&lt;/a> of various size which retraced in part the layout of the allées and &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300239937">flower-beds&lt;/a> of the ancient garden: “This garden, reconstructed by one of our cleverest landscape artists, with its display of classic bushes and flowers, its colonnade lining the four sides of the square, and its array of statues of eminent men, bankers, merchants, magistrates, harbour-masters, &amp;amp;c., has become the chief attraction to the visitors of Ostia…” The leading experts in garden architecture of the period included Pier Andrea and Domenico Saccardi: perhaps one of them was the “cleverest landscape artist.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>DESCRIPTION&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian's family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor's death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial &lt;em>praedia&lt;/em>. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS &lt;em>ET ALII&lt;/em> 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON &lt;em>ET ALII&lt;/em> 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian's death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="garden-description">Garden Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Canopus (Fig. 2 and 3) is perhaps the most important of all Villa Adriana's gardens (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 152-162, fig. 11-15; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992, pp. 579-585, tavv. I-IV; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 374-383, fig. 9-13; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 323-324, fig. 80-81, 87, 134-135). It was set at the principal entrance through which Hadrian's important guests were introduced when they came to visit the emperor. Thus the breathtaking view of the Canopus was the first impression visitors received entering this imperial residence. Their glance ran along the narrow valley set at the South side of Villa Adriana's principal entry. An imposing waterway occupied all its length (Fig. 4). Columns and white marble statues reflected themselves in its blue water, and two statuary groups, both representing Scylla in the act of killing Ulysses' mates, emerged from the canal. It was here that Hadrian held his most important receptions and the banquets that, from time to time, he offered to his subjects (MART. 8.49; 9.91). As in ancient Rome dinner began around two o' clock p.m., and as, at this moment, the sun was still very high and very hot, a portico ran along the eastern bank offering its shade to those guests who had to dine on the sunny side (Fig. 2, A). On the opposite one, which was already protected by the hill, there was no portico (Fig. 2, B), but four beautiful copies of the Erecteum's Caryatids and of two Sylens were set on the canal's edge and were reflected on the water (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 175-178, figs. 13-20, 35-37). The spectacle was superb: the golden color of the portico's columns, fashioned in the yellow marble of Shimtou, stood out against the green of the well-cut hedges of box-tree that bordered the lowest part of the valley (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000a), while high terraces rose at its two sides scaling the surrounding hills (Figg. 4 and 5) To complete the landscaping, a monumental &lt;em>exedra&lt;/em>, (Fig. 6) and two elegant pavilion set at its sides (Figg. 2. D and D1 7) decorated the end of the valley (Fig. 2, C). In the old times the exedra was coated with polished marbles and multicolored mosaics. Some of its niches hosted imposing statues and large waterfalls flowed by other ones, while back, at the end of a central long gallery, a powerful cascade fed the outlying waterway (Fig. 2, E). Nothing could have been more pleasant and at the same time more imposing than the Canopus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then excavations in the valley showed the existence of two long flower beds that were set on the two side of the canal (Fig. 8) and in them both we and the Danish archaeologists found amphoras cut in two and with large holes on their sides to let the plant kept in them to branch their roots in the soil and remain strong and flourishing. Our probes are marked on the plan (Fig 2. m; n; o; p; q).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sirmio is known from a citation in Catullus’ XXXI° poem (paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque ocelle ...) and in later road itineraries as a staging post (Sermione mansio) along the road between Verona and Brixia (Brescia), which passed to the south of the peninsula, forming part of the erritory of Verona. In several areas along this ancient coastline remains have been brought to light of large and sumptuous villas built on the coast, in large coves or high places, with beautiful panoramas.The remains of a villa, called by fifteenth-century visitors to the site “Grotte di Catullo”, after Verona’s poet Catullus, are situated at the northern tip of the Sirmione peninsula, on the southern bank of the Benacus(Lake Garda), the largest of the pre-alpine lakes (Fig.1). As one of the most interesting examples of Roman residential architecture in northern Italy, this villa deserves the designation of villa maritima, as other similar examples along the Campanium-Latium coast.The villa covers an area of around 20,000 square meters distributed on three terraces, which ascend the slope of the hill on a series of substructures. The building has a rectangular plan (167.5 x 105 meters), with two foreparts; on the S side at the main entrance and on the N side at the tip of the peninsula, towards which the villa faced, so as to be surrounded by the lake on three sides (Fig. 2).On the evidence of recent studies, the villa is dated to the Augustan-Tiberian period (end of the first century B.C. –start of the first century A.D.): it was constructed after the destruction of an earlier building, the existence of which has been documented in a small archaeological excavation beneath the floor of one of the rooms on the southern side of the villa. Modifications to the building, in particular the creation of the large baths area, date to the end of the first –second century A.D. The destruction of the villa came quickly, with all probability around the 3rd century: at that time the functioning of the villa seems to have stopped and no later maintenance or building interventions have been identified; a differing situation as regards the other villas in the lake Garda area, which had a continued life, with phases of great importance, up to the first half of the fifth century.The building, constructed as a whole and with axial and symmetrical criteria, is characterized by long terraces on the eastern, western and northern sides: these connect directly with the large terrace on the northern forepart, which was shaded by a veiled covering, as demonstrated by the characteristic elements which supported the posts found in this area. By the side of the terraces were long porticoes: the western one built over a double-nave cryptoporticus, which acted as a substructure, the eastern for the main part built directly on the natural bedrock. The residential rooms were distributed in the northern and southern areas, the western part of the latter being occupied by the baths complex (Fig. 3-4).While the substructures are well-preserved, the residential floor, situated on the higher level, has been subject to greater destruction over the course of the centuries, due to the systematic robbing of building materials, already started in ancient times, the collapse of part of the wall on the eastern side along the hill-side, and in the agricultural use of the land, presently occupied by a vast olive grove (Fig. 5). The villa has been excavated on several occasions from the start of the 19th century and subsequently backfilled, so that the plan and hypotheses for the reconstruction for a large part of the residential level, which has not been the object of new research in recent years, are based on the notes and drawings of the 19th century, not always reliable. Other excavations were conducted between 1941 and 1965; research aimed at defining the chronology of the building and resolving problems in the plan of several rooms in the southern area were undertaken between 1984 and 1994.The events endured by the structure render difficult and at times impossible, at present, to hypothesize the functions and characteristics of many of the residential rooms, as also with the various open spaces present within the building. Undoubtedly, other than the large peristyle (C), which occupied the central area of the building, other open spaces, now buried (courtyards or gardens), were to be found along the central N-S axis. In the southern part there was an open space (N), situated between the western part of the villa, destined as the baths complex, and the eastern part containing the living rooms. In this case, according to the interpretation of the director of the first excavations and more recently, the area functioned as a courtyard giving access and light to the rooms on its E, S and W sides. A wall divided the courtyard from the S side of the peristyle, to which direct access was possible by one or more entrances. Another hypothesis suggests that access between the two courtyards was not axial but by a side corridor, while a wall with windows would have permitted a view of the internal garden.Of the other open space (O), situated to the N, there is uncertainty as to its function. One can hypothesize, on the basis of the 19th century plans, an open space with porticoes on all four sides: perhaps another small peristyle. An element which would confirm its use as a courtyard or garden is the presence of a stone-built rainwater drain, still present in the 19th century and illustrated by Orti Manara in his publication on Sirmione. Some parts of this drain have been re-used in the walls of the Early Medieval church of San Salvatore in Sirmione. There are no precise indications for external gardens and it is only possible to hypothesize the natural setting in which the villa was situated. However it must be stated that artificial terraces had been made on the eastern side of the building, or more precisely the areas which corresponded to the N-E and S-E corners, formed by the two foreparts of the villa. In the first (H) the bedrock has been cut to a depth of around 4 meters to create a large terrace, which occupied the whole area as far as the drop in level towards the lake (Fig.6). It is interesting that the second artificial terrace (I), of more limited extension, at around 10 meters below the residential level of the villa and reached by a flight of steps, was still known in the 19th century, by ancient tradition and without apparent justification, as “the garden.”The large central open space (C), beginning from the 19th century, was identified as a courtyard-viridarium. It is formed by an area of around 4000 square meters, equivalent to about one fifth of the whole area of the villa (Fig.7). Both the 19th century excavations and more recent trenches have failed to locate the presence of structures or floors, and it is therefore possible to hypothesize that the area functioned as a garden, probably surrounded on all four sides by porticoes as indicated in the 19th century plans and supported by recent research.The present land use, with many trees, and the thin soil cover in respect to the original ground surface, no longer permit the acquisition of data to allow a more precise reconstruction of the ancient garden, its internal sub-divisions, the types of vegetation, the possible ornamentation. On the S side of the peristyle is located a large perfectly preserved underground cistern (66), of a length corresponding to the width of the peristyle (42.60 x 2.40 meters). It is covered by a herringbone floor in small bricks, 6 meters wide and around 50 meters long (fig.8). Rainwater, collected in this part of the building, flowed into the cistern through a series of lead fistulae which entered the S-E and S-W corners, as is demonstrated by holes in the floor created by the robbing of the lead pipes, of which fortunately a small part is still preserved in the S-W corner, where it enters the cistern. The floor of the cistern has a slope of 7-8% from S to N: on the northern side four channels collected rain water and allowed it to flow in an organized manner towards the garden, with a slope of 6% (fig.9). The channel was formed in the initial part by a prolongation of the herringbone brick floor, which with its tapering form towards the external area helped the entry of rainwater into the channel, which flowed beneath the ancient ground surface (Fig. 10). The channels, lined with hydraulic mortar, were excavated in the bedrock, which outcropped on the eastern side and were covered with thin stone slabs. On the opposite side they were constructed in the earth and only their lower parts are preserved, the covering and the ancient floor shaving been robbed. Given the slope of the channels, their conformation and number, it is to be excluded that they had the sole function of draining the rainwater from the brick floor, and it may be hypothesized that they also served the function of directing to the garden the water which was extracted from the cistern, perhaps for irrigation.Water was drawn from the cistern by one or more wells: in the 19th century a well-curb, which was said to have come from the area of cistern, was still preserved in Sirmione. By the side of the cut which housed one of the well-curbs, two square holes had been cut into the floor in ancient times. It is hypothesized that they held the posts for the structure supporting the ropes and vessel used to extract water from the cistern (girgillus).There are no other elements to help describe the form of the large peristyle. Two pieces which may have formed part of the decoration of the garden are composed of sculptural fragments: a head dating to the second century A.D., found in the soil inside the cistern (66), and a sundial, presently lost, but fortunately represented by a drawing. Given the location, the head must have come from the peristyle, and can be hypothesized as belonging to the statue of a Dioscuros (fig. 11). In Greek marble, it is broken at the level of the chin. The head is covered by a pilos, from which issue locks of hair, curling on the forehead and sides of the face.There are no useful clues to help reconstruct the vegetation, which may have been present in and around the villa.The climate of Lake Garda is sub-Mediterranean, determined by the notably large mass of water which tends to maintain a constant temperature, much milder than the rest of the cisalpine area. The cultivation of olives already existed in Roman times, as documented by botanical evidence from recent excavations at Sirmione and the strong spread of the plant both in the locality and the whole area around Lake Garda in the Early Medieval period. In the same manner grapes were probably also cultivated, indirectly represented by an inscription found near Sirmione (fig. 12). Probably also common in the Roman period were the native species, shrubs such as oleander and rosemary and trees such as cypress, bay, ash and several species of oak, documented in the last two examples by botanic remains found at Sirmione, recently analyzed by the Archaeobiological Laboratory of the Civic Museums of Como.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>House of the Ephebe; Casa Dell’Efebo; House of P. Cornelius Teges (or Tages).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="garden-description">Garden Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A. This house was made by combining several small houses. The upper garden had an unusual &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> on the north with various diameter &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a>, plastered and painted red, and two &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300264605">pillars&lt;/a>. A third &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">column&lt;/a> on a square base supported an extension of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a>, which was a step lower and formed by an extension of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300083076">vestibule&lt;/a> at entrance 12. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004180">tablinum&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589">exedra&lt;/a> on the upper level of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> were protected from cold and rain by some sort of screen installed between the columns and the west &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300264605">pillar&lt;/a>. Most scholars surmise these were wooden but Maiuri proposed that they were glass, although he did not find any glass fragments during excavation (window panes surviving from this period from other sites are on display at the &lt;em>Museo Archaeologico&lt;/em> in Naples and in the &lt;em>deposito&lt;/em> at Pompeii).&lt;br>
Two steps below the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> was the garden. The back wall had a large animal &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">painting&lt;/a> and a small &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> with a semicircular niche. A relief of Dianna and two deer adorned the front and inside a bronze &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> of Pomona (0.38 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 144 276) stood holding a bivalve shell filled with fruit. Water jetted from the shell, down four marble steps and into the small square &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300375619">pool&lt;/a> below. A marble covered channel divided the &lt;em>lectus medius&lt;/em> of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> in two parts and carried the water to a small jet in the center of the low &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300039548">table&lt;/a>. Four large &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> supported a vine-covered pergola that shaded the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a>. The soil near the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> had root cavities, as reported by Maiuri, but no further details were recorded.&lt;br>
This was the best preserved &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> (l. medius, 4.60 m.; l. imus and l. summus 4.40 x 0.88 m.) in the entire city. Each couch had a marble faced step along the top, and on the sides of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> was painted a series of Nilotic scenes. There were two complete &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">paintings&lt;/a> while the rest of the work comprised a continuous frieze. These scenes depicted Egyptian life that revolved around the periodic inundation of the Nile. Activities pictured included men fishing, a woman spinning under a canopy, worshipers visiting shrines (some shrines in enclosures, some with extensive gardens), banquet scenes, an erotic scene in a &lt;em>caupona&lt;/em>, and a pigmy slave driving a &lt;em>coclea&lt;/em> (water screw).&lt;br>
Attached to each of the north &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006783">pergolas&lt;/a> was a low &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">column&lt;/a> (1.00 m. high) which most likely served as bases for &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a>. In front and a little to the west of the &lt;em>lectus summus&lt;/em> was a large masonry base (0.93 m. high; 0.685 m. in dia.) where Maiuri surmised that the famous bronze &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statue&lt;/a> of the Ephebe stood. This statue (1.49 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 143 753) had been made into a gilded lamp stand holding candelabra brackets and was found in the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004097">atrium&lt;/a> where it had been wrapped and placed for protection against the impending disaster. At either end of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> was an additional pair of low circular bases for &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuettes&lt;/a>. Four broken marble &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuettes&lt;/a> were found in the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a>] where they most likely were brought for protection or perhaps for repair after the earthquake. A &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a> of Pan holding a fruit-filled &lt;em>calathos&lt;/em> on his left shoulder and a ram’s head in his right hand (0.60 m. high with base; Pompeii inv. no. 3682) was reconstructed from nineteen fragments. The white marble piece had been completely gilded. There was also an inebriated satyr of white marble, (the head was missing) sprawled on a gray marble rock and opening a wineskin (0.32 m. long; 0.27 m. high with base; Pompeii inv. no. 3684). Only the necklace, bracelet, and several other details were gilded on this piece. A completely gilded &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a> of a deer suckling a fawn (0.35 m. long; 0.22 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 3683) and the remains of a gray marble base with white marble goat feet of Pan standing on a &lt;em>scabellum&lt;/em>, the typical instrument of satyrs (0.28 m. long; 0. 105 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 3685) were found there. There were also four vulgar silver-plated &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuettes&lt;/a> of
&lt;em>placentarii&lt;/em> or pastry vendors (each with base, 0.255 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. nos. 143 758, 143 759, 143 761, 143 761 bis). Each carried a silver tray which Maiuri surmised were used to hold food delicacies served at dinner parties in the garden &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuettes&lt;/a> as well as the delicacies were found stored together in the house.
A trellis &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> separated the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> from the eastern part of the garden. The trellis was supported by four slender marble posts and on top of these were four small sculptured heads (herms). These pieces were: an archaic style head of Zeus rendered in white marble (0.19 m. high) with traces of bright colors, an archaic bust of Hera (0.135 m. high), a head of a woman (0.145 m. high) carved in yellow marble, and a Bacchic head of a child made from red marble. A plain round &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300039548">table&lt;/a> and a curved marble seat were found in the center of the garden. The excavation revealed soil arranged in furrows, as customary for &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008142">vegetable gardens&lt;/a>, and root cavities of small plants.
Water was supplied to the garden by way of overflow channels from the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a>. A basin, with two terra-cotta openings which would regulate the flow of water to either half of the garden, was located at the edge of the garden. The south wall at the rear of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> once had a large hunt scene, but the only surviving part was the lower register. To the left of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> the images of a large deer and a bird remain, and to the right a bull flees from an unidentified attacker. A feline is crouched under a large tree in the lower right and other trees are sketchily depicted in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>B. This &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971">peristyle&lt;/a> garden was entered by way of seven steps from the garden of the House of the Ephebe. This part of the building had once been a separate house (19). A &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> supported by seven &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a>, two of them &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001638">engaged&lt;/a>, enclosed the garden on the north and part of the east side. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> were plastered masonry, painted white on the top and red on the bottom and each had a rectangular hole, 1.70 m. from the bottom, on the side in line with the other &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a>. It is speculated that these were for wooden beams that held privacy screens or mats which would shield the garden area from heat and cold. The intercolumniation in front of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589">exedra&lt;/a> did not have these holes, as it offered a fine view on the garden. A lead pipe with a tap directed water from the garden above into a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300400601">dolium&lt;/a>
near the corner column. The pipe attached to the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">column&lt;/a> had been shaped to resemble a snake &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a>. Nearby a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052558">cistern&lt;/a> collected water from the channels on the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> roof and a puteal was located on the top of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052558">cistern&lt;/a>. East–west furrows were preserved in the soil and the south, west and part of the east wall of the garden had garden &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">paintings&lt;/a>. Two large niches were located in the north wall of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> east of the garden steps and there was an arched niche in the west wall of the north &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a>. In the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589">exedra&lt;/a> off the north &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> a broken herm of Dionysus (0.12 x 0.19), was found, which was possible a garden decoration. The walls of this &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971">peristyles (Roman courtyards)&lt;/a> garden were painted with very fine garden &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">paintings&lt;/a> on part of the east wall and the other three sides. Slender painted &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">columns&lt;/a> complete with painted garlands suspended between them, created the appearance of extending the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> and divided the walls into panels. The excavators found the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">paintings&lt;/a> had been badly damaged, the best preserved was the north panel on the west wall. This showed a slender marble crater
&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> on a decorated &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571">column&lt;/a> standing in a semi-circular niche formed by a low lattice &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a>. A photograph taken at the time of excavation shows that behind the fence the bushes represented were myrtles with an oleander on the right. In the background there was a date palm with lower leaves trimmed and new growth showing. This palm was flanked by two laurel trees (&lt;em>Laurus nobilis L.&lt;/em>). Various birds occupied the thickets and there was a bird perched on the fence, one on the rim of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> and one on one of the garlands. The center panel next to this was partially preserved and what remained was the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">painting&lt;/a> of a shallow, round, bubbling &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> supported by three legs located in a three sided niche formed by the lattice &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a>. Again there were myrtles behind the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> with a slender cypress on the right. Traces of a date palm remain in the center background. The center of the south wall was occupied by a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300312262">statuette&lt;/a> of Venus standing on a circular base, although this had to be deduced from the part of the painting which survived, which only went knee high on the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statue&lt;/a>. A fragment of a narrow animal painting survived on the west wall above a garden painting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>C. Behind the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004180">tablinum&lt;/a>, and seen from the entrance (no. 19), a small light well served as a garden. It was &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300033644">painted&lt;/a> to represent a garden and the floor had been paved. The only surviving images were the usual &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> with faint traces of oleander bushes and birds. Further traces indicated that a statuette of Venus standing on a marble base in an apsed niche in the lattice &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> may have been represented on the east wall. The lattice &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005044">fence&lt;/a> on the north wall was painted to represent a rectangular niche. Water was piped from the garden above through the lower part of the rear wall and possible supplied a jet in the middle of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300129867">impluvium&lt;/a>, as surmised by Maiuri.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Roman intervention in Greek political affairs resulted in conflicts that led to the destruction of Corinth in 146 B.C. and the sacking of Athens in 86 B.C. It was not until 27 B.C., however, that Augustus formally organized the Roman province of Achaea. Achaea consisted of the cities and territories of the southern Greek mainland between the Peloponnese and Thessaly, as well as Epirus in the northwest and the Ionian and some of the Aegean islands.
The provincial capital was Corinth. Under Nero in the mid-1st century A.D. Epirus became a separate province, and in the mid-2nd century Thessaly was detached and added to the province of Macedonia. Under Roman domination many cities such as Athens, Sparta, Patras, and Corinth grew in size and prominence, the latter two partly owing to their importance as ports. After an initial decline in the number of rural sites in the early Empire, by the late Roman period the countryside was densely settled with farms and villas, due to changing landholding patterns and Roman improvements in agricultural and irrigation technology. The main exports from Achaea were wine, particularly from the northern Peloponnese, as well as olive oil and honey, linen and woollen textiles and marbles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A large (20,000 sq. m.) villa on a small hill near the ancient site of Eua has been systematically excavated since the 1980s. Most of the discoveries, however, remain unpublished. Because the earliest remains date to the Flavian period and an inscription mentions the name Hipparchus, father of Herodes Atticus (103-171 A.D.), it is likely that this was family property inherited by Herodes and transformed by him into one of the most luxurious Roman estates in Greece.
At the center of the plan was a large garden defined on three sides (north, south, and east) by porticoes paved in mosaics representing various mythological scenes in a continuous sequence (850 sq. m.). The numerous statues placed in the garden, representing divinities, historical characters, athletes, and philosophers, were part of a decorative program in which the sculptural and mosaic themes were linked. For example, in the north portico, in front of a mosaic depicting Menelaus holding the body of Patroclus, fragments of a statuary group representing the same subject were found (“Pasquino” type). In the south portico, a sculpture of Achilles and Penthesilea (copy of a second century B.C. original from Pergamon) was found in front of a mosaic with the same subject. Other mosaic subjects are the hunt of Aeneas and Dido, the Horai and Charites, the labors of Heracles, and cupids making wine. The eastern part of the villa had a nymphaeum and an exedra, containing six statues depicting girls, one of which dates to the fifth century B.C. The villa also had a Serapeum and an Antinoön.
After the death of Herodes the villa probably became imperial property. A phase dating to the Tetrarchy is attested, and during the time of Constantine a mosaic, depicting the Circus Maximus, was added. The villa was destroyed by an earthquake in A.D. 400 A.D. and by the invasions of the Goths.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Greeks in Homer’s &lt;em>Iliad&lt;/em> sacrificed to Artemis at Aulis in Boeotia in the hopes of favorable winds to carry them from Greek shores to Troy (&lt;em>Il.&lt;/em> &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.301-2.335">2.305-310)&lt;/a>. The late 5th century Athenian playwright, Euripides, made reference to the grove of Artemis in his &lt;em>Iphigenia in Aulis&lt;/em> (&lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg018.perseus-eng1:185-205">185-186&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg018.perseus-eng1:1532-1577">1543-1549&lt;/a>). The shrine of Artemis at Aulis was visited by Pausanias in the 2nd century A.D., and he noted white stone statues (presumably marble) of Artemis and palm trees growing in the sanctuary &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.19">(9.19.6-8)&lt;/a>. According to him, the fruit was not all edible, as it was in Palestine, but he remarked that the fruit ripened better than the dates in Ionia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The three most famous gymnasia in Athens, situated outside the city in naturally well-watered and shady sanctuaries of pre-Classical date, were those in the suburbs. In the &lt;strong>Academy&lt;/strong> there was a shrine of the hero Hekademos; the &lt;strong>Lykeion&lt;/strong> had a sanctuary of Apollo; and a cult site of Herakles was located in &lt;strong>Kynosarges&lt;/strong>. The gymnasia in these suburbs were especially revered in Roman times as prestigious educational centers. They included running tracks and other sports grounds for physical training, rooms for literary instruction and baths spread out over a large area and loosely added to in the course of time. In each of the three areas foundation walls of a building enclosing a palaestra, or sports ground, of the 4th century B.C. have been excavated. Roman building activity in the Athenian suburbs is confirmed by Pausanius &lt;a href="http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.18">(1.18.9)&lt;/a>. According to him, Hadrian had a gymnasium named after him outside the walls of Athens near the Ilissos River in Kynosarges, although it is unclear whether he actually had a new gymnasium built here in the 2nd century A.D. or if he merely refurbished the old one. Roman honorific inscriptions and baths erected on the sites of the three suburban gymnasia indicate that they were kept up and modernized well after the Classical period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ancient literary references to the plane, elm, poplar, and olive trees in the Academy are numerous. Excavations in the suburb of Academy have shown that a new gymnasium was built there in the late Hellenistic/early Roman period. This gymnasium consisted of a central courtyard enclosed by porticoes on all four sides (Fig. 1). The northern wing of the building complex contained rooms which were probably used as libraries and for lectures, while the south, west and east wings appear to have had a row of desks, of which only the stone bases remain, running down the middle of each corridors. The courtyard itself may have been used as a palaestra for training, although by this period Greek education focused less on physical training than on lectures, debates, and literary study. The courtyard had a pool in the center (P on plan) and a podium for statues (S on plan), possibly of the Muses, at the northern end, both of which certainly would have restricted any space for athletics. No paving in the courtyard could be found, and it possible that it was planted in some way, perhaps with shade trees (G on plan).&lt;/p>
