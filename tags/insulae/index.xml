&lt;h3 id="garden-description">Garden Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A. Over half the depth of the insula was crossed by a long angiportus which led from the Via dell’Abbondonza to an open area (a) past a wide portico. This extensive area was most likely used as a garden having a water basin in the southwest corner for irrigation. The first two columns in the portico, on the east were connected by a wall 2.13 m. high. There was a street entrance (38) on the south side of the garden next to the entrance of house no. 37, the house to which this garden originally belonged. A gutter along the north, east and south edges of the garden conducted the water to the lowest spot in the southeast corner where it emptied into the street.
B. A complex of rooms opened off the northeast end of the portico and a garden (b) was located beyond these with an entrance on the west. (Fig.17, 11.17.59.) A large terra-cotta puteal was discovered in one of the adjoining rooms. The cistern opening in this garden received water from a large basin in the southeast corner supplied by a gutter on the west, south and north edges.
C. Off the west end of the angioportus was opening 15 which led to another large area (c) that had been used as a garden at the time of the eruption. Apparently half of the area had been filled with structures destroyed by the earthquake, cleared, and converted to a garden but Mau believed the eastern part had always been cultivated. (Fig.18, 11.20.59) This area could be entered from no.16 and so he concluded that the same owner held both properties. The east wall had a niche 2.65 m. from ground level, too high to serve as a laririum, which probably contained a terra-cotta statuette. Jashemski observed that two half buried puteals were being used as planters and questioned their original location.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After the earthquake the eastern part of this insula had been converted into a market garden. When it was excavated in 1883-1884 some of the soil contours remained. A basin in the northwest corner collected water that was diverted from the street. Gardening tools were found in this garden and the remnants of the earlier structure that stood here, an animal painting on the south wall and a simple aedicula shrine in the southwest corner, indicated that this had been a home.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Large garden planted with trees and decorated with a water channel (euripus), garden paintings, garden statues, and a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300170371">biclinium&lt;/a> and triclinium](&lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359)">http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359)&lt;/a>. Inside, a spacious &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029">peristyles (Roman courtyards)&lt;/a> with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountains&lt;/a> was decorated with flowers in planting boxes and ornamentals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="garden-description">Garden Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A. The spacious Tuscan &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004097">atrium&lt;/a> of this luxurious house excavated in 1918-1921 was a lavish garden. A low, double masonry wall, faced with marble on the outside, bordered the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300129867">impluvium&lt;/a> and according to Spinazzola, the space between the walls had been lined with wood to form a planting box for flowers and ornamentals. The pool had a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179">fountain&lt;/a> base, which may have held a statuette, and bases in the center of each side may have held additional statuary. On the north side of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300129867">impluvium&lt;/a> pipe remains, as well as the cavity where the pipe emerged from under the south base, were excavated. Bombing during WWII extensively damaged the other two sides but these have since been restored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>B. At the rear of the atrium a modest &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029">peristyles (Roman courtyards)&lt;/a> garden was enclosed by a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> on the east, north and west sides. The supporting columns were smooth and colored red at the base, and fluted and white at the top. A very low wall joined all of the columns. Two circular beds in the center of the garden and a bed bordering the edges with a path between, entered from the south, were shown on the large plan by Spinazzola (see p.376). Although a dot in the center of each circular bed could represent a root cavity, no mention is made of soil contours or root cavities. A glazed terra-cotta statuette of Bes, the Egyptian deity (Pompeii inv. no. 2897) and of a pharaoh (Pompeii inv. no. 2898) were found but indications were that many other statuettes from this garden had been carried away by ancient excavators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>C. A vine covered &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> terrace stretched across the back of the house immediately behind the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029">peristyles (Roman courtyards)&lt;/a>. Animal paintings decorated the north wall of the terrace. There were two panels of deteriorating images that had been quickly rendered. Lions, lionesses, tigers and leopards pursuing bulls, deer, gazelles and hares were noted by Spinazzola. Jashemski recorded seeing the faded images of a deer, lion, and a bull and several unidentified images in the west panel. She reported that the east panel was in poor condition but she could make out lions and a deer being attacked by an unnamed animal. At the east end of the terrace, between two masonry couches of a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300170371">biclinium&lt;/a> (l. imus 2.78; l. summus 3.40 m.), two columns framed an &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> niche. To the wall right of the niche was a painting of Pyramus and Thisbe, to the left a painting of Narcissus. A marble telamon in the form of a kneeling satyr (Pompeii inv. no. 2891) found on the terrace was thought by Spinazzola to have been a fountain head. This would have stood on the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> with a basin on his shoulders, spilling water down into the channel. Dr. Salza Prina Ricotti disagreed, pointing out that there is no evidence of piping either in the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicules&lt;/a> or the statuette. The channel, or euripus, measured 1.00 m. wide and 1.40 m. deep and extended 20 m. along the terrace. The inside of the channel was painted blue and small statues were set in the narrow strip of garden along the sides. Proceeding from east to west, the statues were as follows: on the south side, the head of a bearded Dionysus (Pompeii inv. no. 2910); across the channel on the north side, the bust of a young Dionysus (Pompeii inv. no. 2918); next on the south, a lion holding a ram’s head (Pompeii inv. no. 2922); across from this, a lion devouring an antelope (Pompeii inv. no. 2929); next on the south, the mask of a woman sculptured in a console (Pompeii inv. no. 2928); opposite this, a sphinx (Pompeii inv. no. 2930); next on the north side, a seated baby satyr with head and hands raised (Pompeii inv. no. 2931)(this piece disappeared in 1960); an infant Hercules strangling two serpents (Pompeii inv. no. 2932); opposite this, a greyhound attacking a hare (Pompeii inv. no. 2934). A bearded river god (Pompeii inv. no. 2932) looked down the channel from its source, and on the base between the pillars of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145">portico&lt;/a> stood a statue of the Muse Polyhymnia (Pompeii inv. no. 2917) and one of Mnemosyne (Pompeii inv. no. 2909). These two marble statues bore traces of paint. The channel was crossed by two small bridges, one crossing by the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300170371">biclinium&lt;/a>. The other crossed in front of the grand triclinium opening just off the north side of the terrace. The &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> offered a view across the bridge to a tetrastyle pavilion. Here fountains spouted water into the channel at the edge of the plinth of the pavilion. The lower garden that extended the length of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300000325">insula&lt;/a> could be viewed from this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>D. A nymphaeum in the lower garden was located directly under the tetrastyle pavilion. Water cascaded into this from the pavilion and the upper channel. Brightly colored paintings of fish surrounded a marble mask of a water deity on the rear wall of the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006809">nymphaeum&lt;/a>. Just below, seated above little marble steps where the water tumbled down to the channel, was a marble amorino holding a mask (0.236 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 20513). The narrow channel continued more than 50 meters down the length of the garden and was interrupted by three structures. Before the first pergola, three jets of water issued from two low columns and a pillar spaced evenly in the channel. The vine covered &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006783">pergolas&lt;/a> covered an elaborate fountain where water issued from the center of the structure and flowed down four steps in four directions to the pool. A small pavilion was built over the next pool and the final pool had another vine covered &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006783">pergolas&lt;/a> shading a jet of water near the end of the channel. Although this series of pools and channels varied, they were all connected as one feature. Spinazzola suggested that the pools were used for raising different species of fish which would have separate habitat requirements. Shade and cover for the fish would have been supplied by the pavilion and hollows in the first marble fountain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was evidence of long vine &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006781">arbors&lt;/a> on each side of the channel and cavities of large shade trees lined the side walls, although no measurements were recorded. On the east side of the garden by the row of shade trees, forty-four &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300148696">amphorae&lt;/a> were found buried in the soil. Rows of smaller trees or shrubs filled the area between the shade trees and the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006781">arbors&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A masonry &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359">triclinium&lt;/a> stood to the east of the first fountain and here two sculptured supports for a marble table were found. The west side of the covered passageway once had wooden benches, and near the wall at the south end of the garden a one-third life size statuette of a sleeping hermaphrodite (Pompeii inv. no. 3021) was discovered. An entrance from the Via di Castricio allowed direct access to the garden.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="location-description">Location Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia Antica&lt;/a>, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ostium#Latin">&lt;em>ostium&lt;/em>&lt;/a>) of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber">Tiber&lt;/a>, where it flowed into the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/1112319">Tyrrhenian sea&lt;/a>. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> century by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius">king Ancus Marcius&lt;/a>; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a &lt;em>colonia maritima&lt;/em> in the 4&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> century BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3&lt;sup>rd&lt;/sup> century BCE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the 2&lt;sup>nd&lt;/sup> century BCE Ostia (and later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus">Portus&lt;/a>) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century BCE. They were &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005506">&lt;em>domus&lt;/em>&lt;/a> of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_bucrania/">House of the Bucrania&lt;/a>). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_on_via_del_tempio_rotondo/">House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo&lt;/a>, which dates to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustan period&lt;/a>, the one found below the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/schola_of_trajan/">Schola of Trajan&lt;/a> (built 20-40 CE) and the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_thunderbolt/">House of the Thunderbolt&lt;/a>, datable to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian">Vespasianic period&lt;/a> (69-79 CE). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_of_the_fortuna_annonaria/">House of Fortuna Annonaria&lt;/a>, with its garden (140-190 CE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2&lt;sup>nd&lt;/sup> century CE, under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">&lt;em>insula&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the façade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian">Hadrianic period&lt;/a>, for example in some &lt;em>insulae&lt;/em> that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/insula_dei_dipinti/">Insula of the Paintings&lt;/a>, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its façade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3&lt;sup>rd&lt;/sup> and 4&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> centuries, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the &lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/italia/ostia/house_of_amor_and_psyche/">House of Amor and Psyche&lt;/a>), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.stoa.org/hippo/text9.html#TB9C10S23">&lt;em>Confessions&lt;/em> 9.10.23&lt;/a>), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Monica">St. Monica&lt;/a> in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1&lt;sup>st&lt;/sup>-3&lt;sup>rd&lt;/sup> century CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> century CE “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (&lt;em>Cosmographia&lt;/em>: 25.25-30).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The large open area in this &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300000325">&lt;em>insula&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, divided into two by a wall, was identified as a garden at the time of excavation (1914 to 1919), but on little evidence apart from the absence of paving over most of the area. Recent excavations have however clarified the phases of the garden and added some significant detail. The garden is now known to have been created as a single area, forming an integral part of the late &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300107350">Hadrianic&lt;/a> development comprising the three houses which make up the Insula of the Paintings (House of Jove and Ganymede, House of the Infant Bacchus and House of the Paintings). The excavations in the SW corner of the south garden (Fig. 1, Tr. 1) however produced no evidence of Hadrianic garden features, due to the garden being greatly disturbed by a substantial restoration of the &lt;em>insula&lt;/em> somewhere in the period 150-180 CE. At this time the wall dividing the garden into two was built, and a humus-rich soil imported into the south garden area, its use as a garden being confirmed by fragments of five &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300194749">flower pots&lt;/a>, recognized by the holes in their bases. In addition, the lower part of a &lt;a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/amphora_ahrb_2005/details.cfm?id=83">Dressel 20&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphora#cite_note-12">amphora&lt;/a> and a neat, sub-triangular pit roughly 50 cm across cut into the underlying rubble fill may have served as planters. In the &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300020566">Severan&lt;/a> period a small &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002574">aedicular&lt;/a> shrine was added to the south face of the new garden wall, the niche being originally decorated with glass &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300015342">mosaic&lt;/a> above foliage plants against a red ground. This was later covered with &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300015042">whitewash&lt;/a> and replaced by a figured scene, and finally a &lt;a href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600">statue&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)">Jove&lt;/a> was installed in the niche. A section of black-and-white geometric mosaic, overlying the humus-rich soil in Trench 1 and possibly associated lightweight rough walls, suggests the creation of a summer pavilion or dining room during this period, which would have enjoyed a view of the garden shrine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sirmio is known from a citation in Catullus’ XXXI° poem (paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque ocelle ...) and in later road itineraries as a staging post (Sermione mansio) along the road between Verona and Brixia (Brescia), which passed to the south of the peninsula, forming part of the erritory of Verona. In several areas along this ancient coastline remains have been brought to light of large and sumptuous villas built on the coast, in large coves or high places, with beautiful panoramas.The remains of a villa, called by fifteenth-century visitors to the site “Grotte di Catullo”, after Verona’s poet Catullus, are situated at the northern tip of the Sirmione peninsula, on the southern bank of the Benacus(Lake Garda), the largest of the pre-alpine lakes (Fig.1). As one of the most interesting examples of Roman residential architecture in northern Italy, this villa deserves the designation of villa maritima, as other similar examples along the Campanium-Latium coast.The villa covers an area of around 20,000 square meters distributed on three terraces, which ascend the slope of the hill on a series of substructures. The building has a rectangular plan (167.5 x 105 meters), with two foreparts; on the S side at the main entrance and on the N side at the tip of the peninsula, towards which the villa faced, so as to be surrounded by the lake on three sides (Fig. 2).On the evidence of recent studies, the villa is dated to the Augustan-Tiberian period (end of the first century B.C. –start of the first century A.D.): it was constructed after the destruction of an earlier building, the existence of which has been documented in a small archaeological excavation beneath the floor of one of the rooms on the southern side of the villa. Modifications to the building, in particular the creation of the large baths area, date to the end of the first –second century A.D. The destruction of the villa came quickly, with all probability around the 3rd century: at that time the functioning of the villa seems to have stopped and no later maintenance or building interventions have been identified; a differing situation as regards the other villas in the lake Garda area, which had a continued life, with phases of great importance, up to the first half of the fifth century.The building, constructed as a whole and with axial and symmetrical criteria, is characterized by long terraces on the eastern, western and northern sides: these connect directly with the large terrace on the northern forepart, which was shaded by a veiled covering, as demonstrated by the characteristic elements which supported the posts found in this area. By the side of the terraces were long porticoes: the western one built over a double-nave cryptoporticus, which acted as a substructure, the eastern for the main part built directly on the natural bedrock. The residential rooms were distributed in the northern and southern areas, the western part of the latter being occupied by the baths complex (Fig. 3-4).While the substructures are well-preserved, the residential floor, situated on the higher level, has been subject to greater destruction over the course of the centuries, due to the systematic robbing of building materials, already started in ancient times, the collapse of part of the wall on the eastern side along the hill-side, and in the agricultural use of the land, presently occupied by a vast olive grove (Fig. 5). The villa has been excavated on several occasions from the start of the 19th century and subsequently backfilled, so that the plan and hypotheses for the reconstruction for a large part of the residential level, which has not been the object of new research in recent years, are based on the notes and drawings of the 19th century, not always reliable. Other excavations were conducted between 1941 and 1965; research aimed at defining the chronology of the building and resolving problems in the plan of several rooms in the southern area were undertaken between 1984 and 1994.The events endured by the structure render difficult and at times impossible, at present, to hypothesize the functions and characteristics of many of the residential rooms, as also with the various open spaces present within the building. Undoubtedly, other than the large peristyle (C), which occupied the central area of the building, other open spaces, now buried (courtyards or gardens), were to be found along the central N-S axis. In the southern part there was an open space (N), situated between the western part of the villa, destined as the baths complex, and the eastern part containing the living rooms. In this case, according to the interpretation of the director of the first excavations and more recently, the area functioned as a courtyard giving access and light to the rooms on its E, S and W sides. A wall divided the courtyard from the S side of the peristyle, to which direct access was possible by one or more entrances. Another hypothesis suggests that access between the two courtyards was not axial but by a side corridor, while a wall with windows would have permitted a view of the internal garden.Of the other open space (O), situated to the N, there is uncertainty as to its function. One can hypothesize, on the basis of the 19th century plans, an open space with porticoes on all four sides: perhaps another small peristyle. An element which would confirm its use as a courtyard or garden is the presence of a stone-built rainwater drain, still present in the 19th century and illustrated by Orti Manara in his publication on Sirmione. Some parts of this drain have been re-used in the walls of the Early Medieval church of San Salvatore in Sirmione. There are no precise indications for external gardens and it is only possible to hypothesize the natural setting in which the villa was situated. However it must be stated that artificial terraces had been made on the eastern side of the building, or more precisely the areas which corresponded to the N-E and S-E corners, formed by the two foreparts of the villa. In the first (H) the bedrock has been cut to a depth of around 4 meters to create a large terrace, which occupied the whole area as far as the drop in level towards the lake (Fig.6). It is interesting that the second artificial terrace (I), of more limited extension, at around 10 meters below the residential level of the villa and reached by a flight of steps, was still known in the 19th century, by ancient tradition and without apparent justification, as “the garden.”The large central open space (C), beginning from the 19th century, was identified as a courtyard-viridarium. It is formed by an area of around 4000 square meters, equivalent to about one fifth of the whole area of the villa (Fig.7). Both the 19th century excavations and more recent trenches have failed to locate the presence of structures or floors, and it is therefore possible to hypothesize that the area functioned as a garden, probably surrounded on all four sides by porticoes as indicated in the 19th century plans and supported by recent research.The present land use, with many trees, and the thin soil cover in respect to the original ground surface, no longer permit the acquisition of data to allow a more precise reconstruction of the ancient garden, its internal sub-divisions, the types of vegetation, the possible ornamentation. On the S side of the peristyle is located a large perfectly preserved underground cistern (66), of a length corresponding to the width of the peristyle (42.60 x 2.40 meters). It is covered by a herringbone floor in small bricks, 6 meters wide and around 50 meters long (fig.8). Rainwater, collected in this part of the building, flowed into the cistern through a series of lead fistulae which entered the S-E and S-W corners, as is demonstrated by holes in the floor created by the robbing of the lead pipes, of which fortunately a small part is still preserved in the S-W corner, where it enters the cistern. The floor of the cistern has a slope of 7-8% from S to N: on the northern side four channels collected rain water and allowed it to flow in an organized manner towards the garden, with a slope of 6% (fig.9). The channel was formed in the initial part by a prolongation of the herringbone brick floor, which with its tapering form towards the external area helped the entry of rainwater into the channel, which flowed beneath the ancient ground surface (Fig. 10). The channels, lined with hydraulic mortar, were excavated in the bedrock, which outcropped on the eastern side and were covered with thin stone slabs. On the opposite side they were constructed in the earth and only their lower parts are preserved, the covering and the ancient floor shaving been robbed. Given the slope of the channels, their conformation and number, it is to be excluded that they had the sole function of draining the rainwater from the brick floor, and it may be hypothesized that they also served the function of directing to the garden the water which was extracted from the cistern, perhaps for irrigation.Water was drawn from the cistern by one or more wells: in the 19th century a well-curb, which was said to have come from the area of cistern, was still preserved in Sirmione. By the side of the cut which housed one of the well-curbs, two square holes had been cut into the floor in ancient times. It is hypothesized that they held the posts for the structure supporting the ropes and vessel used to extract water from the cistern (girgillus).There are no other elements to help describe the form of the large peristyle. Two pieces which may have formed part of the decoration of the garden are composed of sculptural fragments: a head dating to the second century A.D., found in the soil inside the cistern (66), and a sundial, presently lost, but fortunately represented by a drawing. Given the location, the head must have come from the peristyle, and can be hypothesized as belonging to the statue of a Dioscuros (fig. 11). In Greek marble, it is broken at the level of the chin. The head is covered by a pilos, from which issue locks of hair, curling on the forehead and sides of the face.There are no useful clues to help reconstruct the vegetation, which may have been present in and around the villa.The climate of Lake Garda is sub-Mediterranean, determined by the notably large mass of water which tends to maintain a constant temperature, much milder than the rest of the cisalpine area. The cultivation of olives already existed in Roman times, as documented by botanical evidence from recent excavations at Sirmione and the strong spread of the plant both in the locality and the whole area around Lake Garda in the Early Medieval period. In the same manner grapes were probably also cultivated, indirectly represented by an inscription found near Sirmione (fig. 12). Probably also common in the Roman period were the native species, shrubs such as oleander and rosemary and trees such as cypress, bay, ash and several species of oak, documented in the last two examples by botanic remains found at Sirmione, recently analyzed by the Archaeobiological Laboratory of the Civic Museums of Como.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/981506">Arabia (province) (Pleiades)&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The history of Roman Arabia begins with the death of the Nabataean king, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbel_II_Soter">Rabb'el II soter&lt;/a>, in A.D. 106. The emperor Trajan annexed the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabataean_Kingdom">Nabataean kingdom&lt;/a> and organized its territory within the new Roman province of Arabia Petraea that occupied a large area of northwestern Arabia, extending from the Hauran in the north, to the Negev and Sinai deserts in the west, and into the northern Hejaz in the south. The administrative district of Perea, formerly under the Herodian dynasty was also added. The provincial capital of Arabia Petraea was located at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosra">Bostra&lt;/a> which replaced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra">Petra&lt;/a> as the capital of Nabataea in the last decades of that kingdom’s independence. Petra continued to function as an important cultural, political and economic center of the province for at least a century following annexation. During the early Byzantine period (4th-6th centuries CE), the major cities of the Roman era continued to flourish, and Christianity gradually became the accepted religion of the area. Petra remained an important center in the early Byzantine period when it was inhabited by a substantial Christian community and was the seat of a bishopric.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The region of Arabia Petraea is primarily a desert environment that belongs to the eastern Mediterranean weather system. Its inhabitants experienced marked seasonal contrasts with dry, hot summers and cold, wet winters. Rainfall occurs during the winter months and ranges from over 600 millimeters in the north-west to as low as 100 millimeters in the south and east of the region.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Nabataean Hawara (Auara) was founded by king &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aretas_III">Aretas III&lt;/a> in the early first century BCE as a trading post along the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Highway_(ancient)">King's Highway&lt;/a>, midway between the Nabataean capital, &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/697725">Petra&lt;/a>, and the port town of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqaba#Classical_antiquity">Aila&lt;/a> on the Gulf of Aqaba (Fig. 1). In the early 2nd century CE, under Roman occupation, a fort was erected at the site (Roman Hauarra/Havarra) due to its strategic position on the major trade highway that was rebuilt as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Traiana_Nova">&lt;em>Via Nova Traiana&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. Associated with the fort was a small town with a bathhouse and a community shrine. The modern name for the site is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humeima">Humayma&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few decades after a Nabataean shrine (Fig. 2) at Hauarra had been severely damaged during the Roman conquest of Arabia Petraea, the site’s inhabitants built another shrine at the same location. The Roman-period shrine occupied the southeast corner of a multi-unit &lt;em>insula&lt;/em> (E125), but could only be accessed from outside the complex. This shrine consisted of a square &lt;em>naos&lt;/em> (containing a central Nabataean &lt;em>baetyl&lt;/em> and legionary altar, bins, shelves, and votive offerings) enclosed in a rectangular open-air temenos (Fig. 3). Upon entering the temenos, worshippers walked to the &lt;em>naos&lt;/em> along a 12.7 m long paved processional way that was flanked by two long raised planters. An aqueduct-fed basin next to the door of the &lt;em>naos&lt;/em> appears to have supplied the shrine with so much fresh water that it must have been intended not just for ritual cleansing, but for supplying the planters as well. Given the relatively shallow depth of the planters, and that no root balls or pots were found within, they probably contained shrubs and/or flowers rather than trees. Although the architect clearly tried to make the planters symmetrical in size, shape, and location, their design (and that of the whole Roman shrine) was constrained by the reuse of some Nabataean walls as foundations.&lt;/p>
