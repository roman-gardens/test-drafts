Keywords porticoes fountains triclinia (couches) trellises headboards Garden Description When the excavation work reached the northeast corner of this house in 1901, a small garden (a) with a proportionately small portico supported by two masonry columns was found. The major part of the garden was occupied by the masonry triclinium (l. medius, 3.00 m.; l. imus and. summus 2.69 m.) with a round table (0.65 m. dia.) and a lectus imus that had a fulcrum. The masonry couch had three large holes that may have received the posts for the pergola, and a marble leopard’s head fountain was found in the first room to the right of the entrance. The large window in the triclinium offered a fine view of the garden.
