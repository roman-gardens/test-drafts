Keywords caupona podium Garden Description This caupona had originally been part of a house according to Fiorelli. The unusual building had a garden (a) in the northeast corner that occupied over one quarter of the house and contained a masonry stibadium, (3.50 m. at the widest dimension), perhaps the only one in Pompeii. A monopodium supported the table and all of this was possibly shaded by a pergola. A portico on the west and south was supported by two square pillars on the south side which were painted with vines. The garden was enclosed by a low wall on the west and south with an entrance on the west.

Keywords caupona [pomerium] Garden Description This caupona, excavated in 1874, had a garden (a) across the back with a low wall on the east and a gutter that ran beside it, most of this covered by a roofed passageway. The northwest corner had a shallow pool, 1.87 x 0.55 m. from which water drained to a into a round basin 0.50 m. dia. on the southeast. Mau thought perhaps this had been a cistern opening. The west wall had a garden painting on the north side. A description by Mau is the only record remaining of this painting, for it was poorly preserved and has since completely deteriorated. The painting was divided into three sections by painted pilasters joined by a fence which formed an apse in the center panel containing a vase shaped marble fountain. Two birds perched on the fence either side of the fountain facing it, the bird on the right was identified as a peacock. Both side panels had a hydria standing on the center fence post and Mau surmised that a bird would have been perched on the fence on either side of the hydria, although only one image of a pigeon survived. A lush garden grew in back of the fence with birds flying across a blue sky above. A little shield and mask hung from the center of the pediment of the center panel and from the arch above each of the side panels. There was a closed up doorway in the south wall which once led to the pomerium. This ancient pomerium was situated between the south wall of this house and the city wall, closed near the Porta di Stabia by a wall and entered through a gate. Soil had been piled obliquely against the wall with high ridges running north-south and smaller ridges diagonally, forming squares. Mau suggested that the high ridges were planted and the low ridges slowed the flow of water in the depressions.

Garden Description The garden east of the atrium had a portico extending along the south and part of the west sides. A low wall (0.52m high) connected the columns and an entrance to the garden was located on the west. In 1873 the caupona was excavated. The garden contained a masonry triclinium (l. medius, 3.85m; l. summus and l. imus, 3.20m) with a table. The badly damaged triclinium revealed the amphorae used in its construction. A low podium along the north wall was thought by Fiorelli to have held flowerpots. Mau reported a drainage channel at the corner of the triclinium formed by the l. meduis and the l. summus, although it is no longer evident. The base of an aedicula lararium remains against the east wall opposite the north end of the east couch.

It was also possible to enter the garden from the side street at entrance 7. Jashemski established in 1975 that the area had been planted due to the presence of scattered root cavities, but extensive damage to the soil prevented the recovery of an accurate planting plan.

Behind this was a tiny garden with three small triclinia on either side. The couches of these six triclinia were so low and narrow they must have been used as seats similar to the tabernae attached to the house of Julia Felix (II.iv.7). B.

Keywords cauponae cisterns (plumbing components) lararia sacella statuettes (free-standing sculpture) tufa Garden Description A. A small garden at the rear of this connected house and caupona may have originally contained the two small statuettes found at this site in 1953. The two pieces were a headless ithyphallic tufa statuette (0.33 m. high with base; Pompeii inv. no. 10017) and a marble statuette of Venus (0.51 m. high without base; Pompeii inv. no. 9926) with much of the red color preserved in the drapery. The inventory books list this house as II.vi.4.
B. The small garden to the rear of house 4 had an entrance into this large open area (b) which had been planted at the time of the eruption. There was a second entrance (6) from the side street. At the time of excavation a cistern was noted in the southwest corner, a basin along the south wall just before the jog, and the presence of seven root cavities. Jashemski found a few other scattered root cavities later, but too much damage had occurred from new growth to determine the original planting plan. At the east end of the north wall a door opened to a small sacellum with an aedicula lararium on a small podium on the rear wall and a small masonry.
