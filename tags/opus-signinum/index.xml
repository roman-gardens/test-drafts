Keywords insula porticoes opus signinum Garden Description The atrium at the front of this house had been converted into a bakery. Towards the back a portico surrounded a small area (a). The portico columns were black at the base and red above, three on the north and three on the south and were connected by a low wall 0.47 m. high, but only the bases survived. The interior area was paved with opus signinum and in the middle there was a rectangle lined with white and gray marble, a yellow marble cross with a red bordered yellow square in the center. This has sustained much damage since it was exposed. At the outside of the paved area there was a gutter with a cistern opening located between the columns on the west side. This area may have contained potted plants. The portico could be entered directly from entrance no. 9 and various rooms opened off of it, the room on the east (b) had the best view into the portico.

Keywords triclinium pergola alabastron opus signinum Garden Description Behind shop no. 10 and the accompanying living quarters was a garden (a) enclosed by a low wall on the east with an entrance on the north end. The excavations in 1906 uncovered a triclinium (l. medius, 4.60 m.; l. imus and l. summus 3.20 m.) attached to the south wall with painted plaster decorating the sides. Against a red background an amorino on the right tries to defend a bunch of grapes he is holding from a pheasant, and an amorino on the left drinks from a bowl while holding off what is perhaps a leopard. The rectangular triclinium table (1.40 x 0.90 m.) had a semicircular cut-out in the front and colored marble shapes inlaid on the top. The semicircular area in front of the triclinium was compacted soil with bits of marble. To the north of the triclinium there was an unusual masonry table (1.11 x 0.73m., 0.90 m. high) with two openings 0.25.m. square on each of the long sides and one on each of the short sides to store food and utensils. The top of this was also inlaid with marble, one circle and various small squares and rhomboids. A beautiful two-handled vase was found inside, made of terra-cotta but evidentially a copy of a silver vase. On the south side of the table there was a white marble statuette of a boy (0.38 m. high) holding a bunch of grapes and a small animal propped up in a small millstone of Vesuvian lava due to the fact the lower part of the statuette had broken off. This was found to the left on a small base. On the right of the statuette was a small rectangular capital of a post, used for garden decoration, with a white marble statuette of a crouching dog 0.16 m. long on the top. Additionally some broken terra-cotta pots were uncovered and two other bases. Soil cavities were found, the three round cavities near the triclinium were possibly the holes for the pergola posts and the others more likely to had been trees. The southwest corner of the garden contained a circular raised planting bed in which Spano reported finding a red terra-cotta pot, wide except for the base and top. Jashemski commented that it was likely a planting pot but was not sure, for Spano did not mention any holes in the pot. Also in this bed a small alabastron was found, similar to ones found in the pre-Roman tombs in the Villa of the Mosaic Columns. Two masonry basins were attached to the north wall on either side of an opening with a lava step leading to the garden to the north. The long basin on the west side had a terra-cotta channel which directed the overflow to the garden. The basin on the east side was deep and faced with opus signinum, collecting water from the neighbor’s roof through a terra-cotta pipe. This garden was also connected to the large garden to the south.

Keywords porticoes triclinium opus signinum dolium lararium pergola Garden Description The extremely long entranceway from the street led all the way to the back of the house into the garden (a) which was excavated in 1906. A portico bordered the garden on the east with four columns, white on top and black on the bottom, connected with a low wall with an entrance on the north end. (Fig.27, 9.31.66) A masonry triclinium (l. medius, 4.60 m.; l. imus 4.96; l. summus 3.75 m.) was located in the northwest side of the garden with a rectangular table (2.00 x 1.45 m.) that had a semicircular indentation in the east end. The couches had been painted red and were faced with opus signinum and the table top was inlaid with a round piece of marble in the center and square pieces of marble all around. Close by on the north wall a small table with an arched niche below also had a top inlaid with marble. The lower part was decorated with painted plants on a red background. A shallow basin on the south side of the triclinium collected rain run-off from the sloping couches and directed it towards the mouth of the cistern at the southwest corner of the basin. There was a bottom half of a large dolium at this corner also. The north wall contained an arched lararium niche with traces of a lararium painting next to it. The root cavity of a very large tree was found near the portico by Spano, as well as various small cavities which could have been posts for a pergola over the triclinium or of small trees. The cavities were not emptied or measured. Like Mau, Spano reported that the area between the south wall of this house and the city wall was filled with soil to a considerable height. He supposed that the furrowed soil indicated the location of a kitchen garden.

Location Ostia
Ostia (Pleiades)
Location Description Ostia Antica, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (ostium) of the Tiber, where it flowed into the Tyrrhenian sea. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7thcentury by king Ancus Marcius; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a colonia maritima in the 4thcentury BCE. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3rdcentury BCE.
From the 2ndcentury BCE Ostia (and later Portus) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.
Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century BCE. They were domus of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the House of the Bucrania). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.
The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo, which dates to the Augustan period, the one found below the Schola of Trajan (built 20-40 CE) and the House of the Thunderbolt, datable to the Vespasianic period (69-79 CE). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the House of Fortuna Annonaria, with its garden (140-190 CE).
Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2ndcentury CE, under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied insula, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the façade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the Hadrianic period, for example in some insulae that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.
The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the Insula of the Paintings, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its façade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.
In the 3rdand 4thcenturies, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the House of Amor and Psyche), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.
The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by St. Augustine (Confessions 9.10.23), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother St. Monica in CE 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.
Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1st-3rdcentury CE). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.
Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5thcentury CE “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (Cosmographia: 25.25-30).

The columns of the peristyle, probably Tuscan, rested on bases alternating with travertine strips at pavement level (Fig. 2). Three perforated vases of the type of ollae perforatae recorded by Cato (RR 52, 133 | Trans.) and Pliny (NH 12. 16; 17. 64, 97) were found between the basin and the columns of the peristyle, and exactly aligned with their bases. The ollae were intact and must have contained plants, no doubt of the flowering and rambling variety, which would have found both a support and a chromatic backdrop in the columns to the rear.

Keywords allées beds (site elements) Augustan Domitian, Emperor of Rome Hadrianic Julio-Claudian columns (architectural elements) opus signinum parterres porticoes scaenae sewers (drainage structures) statues theater Vitruvius Garden Description In the original plan of the Augustan period the garden area to the back of the theater was surrounded on three sides by a roofed corridor opening onto the Tiber on the northern side with a monumental entrance. In the Claudian period the whole level of the area was raised and a portico consisting of a single row of brick columns added. A temple was built at the center of the garden area in the Domitianic period; traditionally identified since its discovery (1881) with the temple of Ceres, it has more recently been attributed to Vulcan or to the imperial cult. During the Hadrianic period the portico was doubled with a second row of columns; the entrances on the northern side were blocked, and buildings erected against them, making access to the garden possible only from the theater (Fig. 1).
The open area to the back of the theater was never built over. Laid out as a garden, and adorned with statues raised in honor of men who had distinguished themselves in trade, it conformed to the recommendation of Vitruvius (5.9.1 | (English) | 5.9.5 | (English)), that areas surrounding a theater be laid out with colonnades (post scaenam porticus) and embellished with gardens, where people could stroll about and converse.
During the excavations of Rodolfo Lanciani (1881) “a street traversing the excavated area of the Forum and aligned on the axis of the temple and the theatre” was identified (Fig. 2). Reported to be “gravelled and edged with marble borders”, this street was probably a path of the garden that led from the theater to the temple at the center of the area: “The Forum of Ceres &amp;hellip; was once ornamented with a garden, the allées of which can still be traced with the help of the marble border-lines by which each plot of green was defined and surrounded.”
During the excavations of Dante Vaglieri (1910-1913), a system of conduits was identified. It was linked to a large sewer that ran underground at the center of the garden area, sloping downwards from south to north in the direction of the Tiber (Fig. 3). Two conduits parallel to the central sewer ran in front of the stationes. At garden level there were two long gutters that collected rainwater from the roof of the portico. Two basins (respectively 3.10x2.90 and 3.45x3.35 m) at ground level were identified on the southern side of the garden; they were paved with opus signinum on the inside and probably panelled in marble.
In October 1912 Dante Vaglieri began the reconstruction of the garden at the center of the Piazzale delle Corporazioni (Fig. 4). He commissioned a famous landscape architect of the period to create a garden with rectangular parterres of various size which retraced in part the layout of the allées and flower-beds of the ancient garden: “This garden, reconstructed by one of our cleverest landscape artists, with its display of classic bushes and flowers, its colonnade lining the four sides of the square, and its array of statues of eminent men, bankers, merchants, magistrates, harbour-masters, &amp;amp;c., has become the chief attraction to the visitors of Ostia…” The leading experts in garden architecture of the period included Pier Andrea and Domenico Saccardi: perhaps one of them was the “cleverest landscape artist.”
