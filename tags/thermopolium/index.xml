Keywords thermopolium triclinia (rooms) lecti lararia Garden Description Customers at this thermopolium were served at a counter looking onto the street and at the masonry triclinium (l. medius, 3.60 m.; l. imus 2.85; l. summus 2.30 m.) in the rear garden. This was located against the north wall to the front of this long, narrow garden and had a round table (0.50 m. in dia.) between the couches and a rectangular table (0.65 x 0.89 m.) at the end of the lectus summus. A niche lararium was next to it with a tufa altar below decorated with a large carved club. A bench for cooking (hearth) was built against the south wall at the west end with two arched openings for fuel storage underneath.
