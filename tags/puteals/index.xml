Keywords porticoes puteals triclinium Garden Description A. The earthquake destroyed an elegant house on this site and this house was subsequently rebuilt on the ruins. A long fauces terminated in the garden (a) which was bounded on the north and part of the east and west sides by a portico. A low wall connected the supporting columns with an entrance on the west and east and two puteals integrated into the wall. The original excavation plan shows a water channel bordering the garden on the west, north and east sides. B. Backed up to the ancient caupona there was a second garden (b) next to the triclinium (c).

Keywords porticoes peristyle tablina triclinium exedra puteals atrium impluvia Garden Description Eighteen partially fluted columns supported the large portico (a) surrounding this spacious peristyle garden. Excavated in 1861, the garden was located at the rear of the tablinum and could be viewed from the large triclinium on the east or the exedra on the west. A wooden fence had enclosed the garden as evidenced by the vertical slots in the columns where the fence had been secured. The portico held two puteals, one marble and the other travertine. A gutter circled the garden and at the south end a pool 0.90 x 1.05 m.; 0.18 m. deep contained a fountain. There was also a fountain located in the atrium, which became a common house feature after the completion of the aquaduct. At the edge of the marble impluvium two ornate trapezophori flanked a round opening containing the bronze water key that controlled the water jet in the center of the impluvium.

Keywords insula angiportus puteals porticoes Garden Description A. Over half the depth of the insula was crossed by a long angiportus which led from the Via dell’Abbondonza to an open area (a) past a wide portico. This extensive area was most likely used as a garden having a water basin in the southwest corner for irrigation. The first two columns in the portico, on the east were connected by a wall 2.13 m. high. There was a street entrance (38) on the south side of the garden next to the entrance of house no. 37, the house to which this garden originally belonged. A gutter along the north, east and south edges of the garden conducted the water to the lowest spot in the southeast corner where it emptied into the street. B. A complex of rooms opened off the northeast end of the portico and a garden (b) was located beyond these with an entrance on the west. (Fig.17, 11.17.59.) A large terra-cotta puteal was discovered in one of the adjoining rooms. The cistern opening in this garden received water from a large basin in the southeast corner supplied by a gutter on the west, south and north edges. C. Off the west end of the angioportus was opening 15 which led to another large area (c) that had been used as a garden at the time of the eruption. Apparently half of the area had been filled with structures destroyed by the earthquake, cleared, and converted to a garden but Mau believed the eastern part had always been cultivated. (Fig.18, 11.20.59) This area could be entered from no.16 and so he concluded that the same owner held both properties. The east wall had a niche 2.65 m. from ground level, too high to serve as a laririum, which probably contained a terra-cotta statuette. Jashemski observed that two half buried puteals were being used as planters and questioned their original location.

Keywords peristyle tablina puteals Garden Description At the time of the eruption this peristyle garden (a) was in the process of renovation. Located behind the tablinium, the white fluted columns on the east and north were still standing, however, all of the columns on the west and two of the south columns had been demolished. There was a rectangular pool 1.06 x 2.56 m. with a semi-circular extension in the back located in the south end of the garden. A low tufa puteal sat over a cistern opening between the first and second columns on the east end of the north side and a gutter encircled the outside edge. According to Jacono, Spano successfully recovered the planting pattern even though it had been excavated many years prior. The design was drawn out in Maiuri’s plan but no accounting was given of how the plan was recovered or what evidence was observed. Jashemski observed that a fence had been mounted on the columns. Holes were bored at 0.96 and 0.44 m. above the ground, some still containing parts of the metal fasteners.

Keywords tablina puteals porticoes Garden Description At the rear of the tablinium excavated in 1881 a narrow garden (a) had a portico on the north supported by one pilaster, one engaged column and five stuccoed free-standing columns. The east end of the garden became very narrow with a jut in the back wall and a small, square water basin was built here against the wall. A water channel was shown in the plan on the east, north and west sides of the garden. The terra-cotta puteal that was found in the portico may have once stood over the cistern opening located between the pillar on the northwest corner and the next column.

Keywords porticoes puteals Garden Description A public garden laid out to the specifications of Vitruvius originally occupied the area at the rear of the Great Theater. There was a seventy four column portico enclosing an area with green plots of trees and shrubs and pathways for promenades. In the later years of the city the colonnade was converted into gladiator barracks and the green space became the training field. A gutter surrounded the area to collect the roof run off. There were two puteals in the east portico.
