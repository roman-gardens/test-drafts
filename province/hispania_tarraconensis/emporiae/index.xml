Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians' numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians' numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).

Keywords atriums (Roman halls) porticoes Garden Description House R2, situated south of House R1 in the area of the forum of the Roman City (Fig. 1), is of totally different design and is smaller, but equally luxurious. In describing the phases of its construction, we follow Tang&amp;rsquo;s account (page 126). (Fig. 2) In its first phase, from the first quarter of the 1st century BC, the area of House R2 was occupied by two separate, similar houses, designated R2A on the south and R2B on the north. Each had a single, central atrium, which opened onto the cardo along the west side. Behind each house, a hortus extended back and was bounded by an intervallum of the city wall. In the second phase, in the second third of the 1st century BC, house R2A expanded, absorbing its own hortus and that of its neighbor, and taking out part of the city wall and extending beyond it to the east. It also acquired the southeastern corner (room [15]) of its neighbor. The old hortus of R2A was replaced by a large garden of 400 square meters enclosed by a peristyle; and a suite of rooms, opening onto the garden, was added. on the east on land formerly outside the city wall. Moreover, a row of rooms [42 – 49] was built behind them and opening to the east. The area beyond them may have been a garden. In the the first century AD, in a third phase, the former hortus of House R2B was converted into a peristyle garden [35a] with porticoes on the east, south and west sides. Along the north side were three, precisely symmetric rooms. The south wall of the central one extended in an arc into the garden. This part of the wall probably had windows opening into the garden. Along the west side of the new peristyle garden a bath complex [30 – 32] was added. A fourth phase at the end of the 1st or beginning of the 2nd second century AD saw a reworking of the eastern side of the house, with a huge room [46] with a triple entrance from the wide portico which now ran along the east side. A large garden extended on to the east a distance not yet determined. The L-shaped portico next to the garden indicated an interest in protecting the garden from the north wind. A small altar with paintings of a serpent and cock was found in the house, possibly in the garden peristyle.

Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need. He describes the linen and esparto grass as of the highest quality. Strabo recorded the tradition of irrigation as a common practice in pre-Roman agriculture (Strabo 3.2.5). This was continued by the Romans, as shown by the number of aqueducts, dams and small reservoirs still to be found on Spanish soil. Pliny, during his stay as procurator in Spain in the first century, gives more specific descriptions of the flora throughout his Natural History (Book XVI). Martial (Epigrams II) refers to myrtle, box and laurel, as common elements to be found in the garden of country houses in Spain.
It is not strange, therefore, that gardening, the work of the topiarius, was usual in Iberian houses, as this study shows. It was not, however, totally new to Spanish territory. Although there are no literary references to gardening in the Pre-Roman era, it must have been part of Iberian culture, as is proved in an unusual way in the northwest of the peninsula in the area under the influence of Greek culture from the city of Emporion (Ampurias or Empuriae). A Hellenic establishment there, Rhode (Rosas), in the third century BC minted drachmas with a rose as the emblem. There were sacred woods connected with the cities. Close to Augustas Emeritas was Lucus Feroniae. Dedicated to Augustus was Lucus Augusti, which gave rise to the present-day Lugo, in Galicia, and another Lucus existed in the environs of Gijón, the Lugo de Llanera (Blázquez, p. 24).
There has been little research on the gardens in the Roman settlements in Spain and Portugal. In drawing up the list of sites with gardens for this catalog, we have accepted that a garden existed when it was so labeled by the excavators. There are, however, many other probable gardens which we have included. Gorges found just under forty villas where enough remained to draw a plan. In them, certain features help to identify a garden. A peristyle alerts us to suspect a garden, but peristyle courtyards were sometimes paved with stones or bricks over a layer of lime. They were clearly not gardens. But if the courtyard had soil in it, it was in all probability a garden. Fountains, fountain statues, and pools are typical of a garden since water is indispensable for a garden. Most peristyles in Roman villas in Spain had ornamental irrigation channels, semicircular pools, wells or pools that gave the impression of still water that, nevertheless, endowed the garden with a cool humidity that favored the cultivation of plants. In Spain, peristyles with drainage are found in the first and second centuries AD and are also common in the late Empire. Certain types of statuary intimately connected with vegetation and nature are found in gardens, such as divinities related to Bacchus and his circle. At Pompeii, Diana, a garden goddess, sometimes paired with Apollo, is also found. Herms were placed on pilasters, as the examples in situ from Pompeii show. Characteristic of Roman villas was the way in which they opened out to the countryside onto a grand vista of gardens and parks filled with fountains.
The roughly triangular province of Tarraconensis, by far the largest of the three provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, stretched across the north side of modern Spain and down the east coast as far as Almeria. On the Atlantic coast, it reached as far south as present Oporto.

Location Emporiae
Emporiae (Pleiades)
Location Description As Strabo (3.4.8) tells us, Greeks from Phokaia, by way of Massalia (Marseilles), established a market town (Emporion) here. Archaeology gives a date of approximately 575- 550 BC. The original settlement was on an island in the mouth of the Fluvià River. About 550, the settlement began to spread south onto the mainland, and the original settlement became known as Palaiapolis, the Old City. For clarity, archaeologists have given this Greek settlement on the mainland the corresponding name of Neapolis, New City. The plural form of the Latin name for the area – Emporiae, “markets” – reflects the dual nature of the city. Though literary sources mention other Greek settlements along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, this is the only one known archaeologically.
Not only was Emporion the point of first contact between the Celtoiberians and Hellenic civilization, it was also here that, in 218 B.C., Roman armies first entered Iberia. The Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Massalia too late to intercept Hannibal on his march into Italy, so he dispatched his brother Cnaeus with part of his forces to Emporion to cut Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s supply lines, while he himself returned to engage the Carthaginian in the Po valley.
Neapolis was settled from north to south. The oldest parts date from before 550 BC. The oldest part of the city wall come from 450 – 425 BC. The Asklepion in the southwest corner was built in the 400 -350 BC period, as a reorganization of an older sanctuary. In the years 375 – 350 BC, a new wall extended farther south. The 2nd century BC saw major building programs. The wall was again extended southwards. A new agora was formed, and the Asklepion reorganized. Public baths were built in the northeastern part of the city about 100 BC. A Serapium was built in the southeastern corner in the first century B.C. Around 100 B.C., a Roman city surrounded by a wall (750 x 350 m) was built on a hill about 150 meters west of Neapolis where there had previously been a structure that was probably the Roman praesidium. We will refer to this area as the Roman City; it is also called the Republican City . Streets were laid out in a rectangular grid, and a large forum occupied the center of the southern half. Just outside the south wall were an amphitheater and a palaestra. Three large houses, two of them with gardens, have been found northeast of the forum and one to the southeast of it. The northern half of the city remains unexcavated. Once development of the Roman City began, Neapolis seems to have been little changed. The two walls between them were dismantled, but – rather strangely – replaced by a single wall, probably in connection with the creation of the Municipium Emporiae in about 36 – 27 B.C.
Neapolis was abandoned in the course of the second half of the first century AD. The Roman City seems to have ceased development at about that time but remained inhabited to nearly the end of the third century. This abandonment of a once-thriving trading town is probably connected with the silting up of the harbor. The mouth of the Fluvià River has shifted seven kilometers to the north, while Palaiapolis, once an island, is now a hill rising out of lowland where the harbor once was.
Publicly funded excavation of the northeastern part of Neapolis and the forum of the Roman City was conducted in 1846-8. Further systematic studies were conducted from 1908 to 1936 under E. Gandía, who took a great interest in stratigraphy before it was common to do so. The Spanish Civil War brought this work to an end, but Gandía&amp;rsquo;s day books have been preserved. Work was resumed in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s and 1950&amp;rsquo;s by M. Almagro, with recent work by R. Mar and J. Ruiz de Arbulo, and B. Tang. Tang emphasizes that it is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a space in a house in Neapolis was open or covered. The difficulty should not be so great in the case of gardens, for any sort of paving or hammered earth rules out the possibility of a garden. She identifies gardens in N5 and N7 and notes that also N 52 near the northern end of the western edge and N 75 on the northern edge “appear to have been provided with gardens or terraces.”

Keywords atrium houses city walls Garden Description These two adjacent houses are typical Tuscan atrium houses, both are against the western city wall, and both have gardens of some 50 square meters at the back of the house (Fig. 1). In Pompeii, Jashemski found many small, non-peristyle gardens in modest homes. Few have been found elsewhere, probably because they were in cities and most ancient cities are under modern ones. This example of two side-by-side is therefore particularly noteworthy. Mar and R. de Arbulo, in their comprehensive volume on Emporiae, give two somewhat different versions of House N5, one on page 366 and one on the foldout map in the pocket at the back of the book. The main differences, however, are in the interpretation of the walls and spaces on the inside of the house and do not affect the interpretation of the garden areas.

Tarraconensis(Pleiades)
Province Description In 236 BC, to offset Carthage&amp;rsquo;s loss of Sicily and Sardinia in the First Punic War, Hamilcar Barca led an expedition into Hispania to establish a colony there. Through force of arms and diplomacy, he spread Carthaginian influence as far north as Barcellona, which bears his name. In 230 BC, Hasdrubal, his son-in-law, established Qart Hadast that became Carthago Nova in Roman times and Cartagena today. After the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Hamilcar&amp;rsquo;s oldest son, took command, attacked Saguntum, and in 218 set out for Italy leaving his younger brother, Hasdrubal, in command in Spain. Through the Alps, he descended into Italy and threatened Rome for fourteen years. Roman armies under the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio kept Hasdrubal in check and prevented his reinforcing Hannibal. They were both killed by the Carthaginians in 212. Two years later, another Publius Cornelius Scipio, the 25-year-old son of the late general of the same name, was sent to Spain. The next year, he captured New Carthage and, in 206 at the battle of Ilipa (about 15 km north of Savilla) destroyed most of the Carthaginians' numerically superior army and ended their hold on Spain. Scipio settled his wounded veterans nearby at a place he called Italica to remind them of their origins. Today, it is one of the best Roman archaeological sites in Italy. After a quick trip back to Rome, where he was elected consul, he returned to Spain and went on to attack Carthage itself. Hannibal was recalled to Africa, but Scipio annihilated his army in 202. Rome thus came into possession of the Mediterranean coast of Iberia.
If Rome was drawn into Hispania to keep the Carthaginians there from supporting Hannibal in Italy, it missed the opportunity offered by Hannibal&amp;rsquo;s defeat to get out of Spain honorably. Instead, in 197 BC it created two new Roman provinces, Hispania Citerior whose capital was Carthago Nova and Hispania Ulterior with Corduba as its capital. Soon after, Rome launched a long war to subjugate the Lusitani, Celtiberians on the west coast. During Sulla&amp;rsquo;s dictatorship, the Lusitani were again in revolt, this time under the able leadership of the Roman general Quintus Sertorius, who sought to create an independent, Roman-like state in Hispania. He established a senate and schools for the sons of the local nobility.
Augustus&amp;rsquo;s conquest of Hispania produced a new territorial division that replaced the earlier two-province organization of the region. Augustus divided the whole of the peninsula into three provinces: Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis, with its capital Tarraco (Tarragona); Hispania Ulterior Baetica, with its capital Corduba (Córdoba); and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania, or Emerita Augusta, with its capital Mérida. The provinces, in turn, were subdivided in administrative legal units, or conventus. The western lands stayed part of the newly demarcated Lusitania, areas into which Romanization had hardly penetrated, in contrast to the other areas of the peninsula where the classical tradition had been incorporated quite early. This division lasted until late antiquity, when Tarraconensis was subdivided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, whose capital continued to be Tarraco (Tarragona), Carthaginiensis, with Carthago Nova (Catagena) as its capital, and Gallaecia, whose capital was Bracara Augusta (Braga, in northern Portugal).
The Mediterranean trio of wine, oil and cereals are the crops most frequently mentioned by all the classical authors when referring to the Iberian Peninsula. These were not the only plants cultivated here. Trogus Pompey, in his Universal History (44. 1-2), praises, as well as those products, the fertility of the soil itself, the benevolence of its climate, the opportune and abundant rains which enable all types of fruits to be gathered, thus supplying every need.

Keywords Augustan stairs House Description This large house, some 4,000 square meters, was long and narrow. (Fig. 2) Various construction phases and uses have been identified. The first phase of the house, which dates to the first century BC, was built around an atrium. The magnificent and unusually large peristyle garden (23 x 29 m) was added in the second phase in the Augustan era and was reached by a little stairway. The garden included a semicircular stone seat, an open space with a pool, and an ambulacros and below it, a subterranean cryptoportico were located on the northeastern side of the garden. The garden offered a spectacular view of the sea
