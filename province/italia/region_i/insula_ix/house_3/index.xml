Excavated in 1952, the garden (a) at the rear of the house had a portico, and a table base carved as a statuette of a small boy with a dove (Pompeii inv. no. 20395) was discovered in the north portico. Fig. 3, Fig. 4. The room in the southwest corner of the garden (b) had a garden representation on the large white middle panel on the south wall of the room. It was framed by a narrow reddish-brown border and painted in shades of brown and white on a light blue-green background. Two gardens enclosed by a wooden fence contained an open apse-shaped area in between them with a round pool. A jet in the center jetted water which descended in two separate streams. The gardens on the side were cut off by the frame. A figure across the front of the painting was perhaps a fence defining a passageway.Fig. 5.
