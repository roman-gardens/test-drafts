Keywords archaeological garden chests (case furniture) columns (architectural elements) gutters (building drainage components) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes statues statuettes (free-standing sculpture) Garden Description A portico enclosed this garden (a) on the north, east and south sides, and the portico on the west had been closed to create rooms. These enclosed columns can be observed incorporated into the wall but only one of the other columns remains standing. The garden was surrounded by a gutter. A small Indian statuette (0.25 m. high) was found in the adjacent shop and it is believed to have been stored in a wooden chest in one of the rooms off the portico with other domestic items. It had tumbled into the shop when the southwest corner of the peristyle collapsed.
