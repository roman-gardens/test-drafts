Keywords palaestrae porticoes Garden Description 555.VI.1/7/8/10. During 1873-1875 the courtyard (a) of the palaestra was excavated. A section of the northeast portico was not excavated until 1930. The courtyard measured 15.75 x 25.25 m. and was bounded by the portico on the west, north and east sides. Engaged columns stood along the south. This area was likely planted after the palestra was built. Although the original excavators labeled this as a garden, no detailed observations were recorded to confirm this supposition.
