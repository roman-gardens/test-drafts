Garden Description Just inside the Porta di Ercolano was a small inn pressed against the city wall that had a garden with a masonry triclinium (l. medius, 3.95 m.; l. imus 4.00; l. summus 3.75 m.). A vine covered pergola had provided shade to the triclinium and the sockets in the back wall where the pergola roof supports fitted were visible when this area was excavated in 1787. Rooms upstairs provided overnight accommodations for guests. A cistern opening in the southwest corner of the garden received water from a gutter that ran along the south edge.
