Keywords insula angiportus puteals porticoes Garden Description A. Over half the depth of the insula was crossed by a long angiportus which led from the Via dell’Abbondonza to an open area (a) past a wide portico. This extensive area was most likely used as a garden having a water basin in the southwest corner for irrigation. The first two columns in the portico, on the east were connected by a wall 2.13 m. high. There was a street entrance (38) on the south side of the garden next to the entrance of house no. 37, the house to which this garden originally belonged. A gutter along the north, east and south edges of the garden conducted the water to the lowest spot in the southeast corner where it emptied into the street. B. A complex of rooms opened off the northeast end of the portico and a garden (b) was located beyond these with an entrance on the west. (Fig.17, 11.17.59.) A large terra-cotta puteal was discovered in one of the adjoining rooms. The cistern opening in this garden received water from a large basin in the southeast corner supplied by a gutter on the west, south and north edges. C. Off the west end of the angioportus was opening 15 which led to another large area (c) that had been used as a garden at the time of the eruption. Apparently half of the area had been filled with structures destroyed by the earthquake, cleared, and converted to a garden but Mau believed the eastern part had always been cultivated. (Fig.18, 11.20.59) This area could be entered from no.16 and so he concluded that the same owner held both properties. The east wall had a niche 2.65 m. from ground level, too high to serve as a laririum, which probably contained a terra-cotta statuette. Jashemski observed that two half buried puteals were being used as planters and questioned their original location.

Keywords peristyle tablina puteals Garden Description At the time of the eruption this peristyle garden (a) was in the process of renovation. Located behind the tablinium, the white fluted columns on the east and north were still standing, however, all of the columns on the west and two of the south columns had been demolished. There was a rectangular pool 1.06 x 2.56 m. with a semi-circular extension in the back located in the south end of the garden. A low tufa puteal sat over a cistern opening between the first and second columns on the east end of the north side and a gutter encircled the outside edge. According to Jacono, Spano successfully recovered the planting pattern even though it had been excavated many years prior. The design was drawn out in Maiuri’s plan but no accounting was given of how the plan was recovered or what evidence was observed. Jashemski observed that a fence had been mounted on the columns. Holes were bored at 0.96 and 0.44 m. above the ground, some still containing parts of the metal fasteners.

This small garden was located to the right of the atrium and the enclosing portico stood on the east, north and west as well as a gutter. There were other paintings on the wall and two large neck-less amphoras filled with lime and crushed lava for making mortar were found inside the garden.

Keywords atrium tablina porticoes Garden Description This house was excavated in 1882 to reveal a small garden (a) at the rear entered by passageways on either side of the tablinium. The portico on the east had one column and two engaged columns with a low wall that allowed entrance on the south end. Rooms on the west probably had a roof that extended over the very narrow passageway. A gutter surrounded the garden. The excavation yielded several sculptures in the garden area; a small crouching lion (0.245 m. long; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 120 057) and a head of a tiger (0.10 m. long; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 120 049), both fitted as fountain spouts; a marble fountain statuette of a dolphin (0.19 m. long; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 120 051) which was found in the atrium; a statuette of a young satyr missing arms and legs (0.315 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 120 048) with an iron pin on the right shoulder for a wall mount; the head of a herm (Mus. Naz. inv. no. 120 050).

There was a band of raised soil at the base of the wall 0.55 m. wide which had been planted and the remainder of the space had been paved. The triclinium on the south and the neighbor’s house on the west received light from this garden.

The east end of the garden became very narrow with a jut in the back wall and a small, square water basin was built here against the wall. A water channel was shown in the plan on the east, north and west sides of the garden. The terra-cotta puteal that was found in the portico may have once stood over the cistern opening located between the pillar on the northwest corner and the next column.
