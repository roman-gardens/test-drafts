Keywords porticoes peristyle [dolia](http ://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300400601) Garden Description These two shops, excavated in 1861, shared a house and a garden (a) to the back. A portico enclosed the garden on all four sides. In the southwest corner of the garden there was a masonry pool with a small water jet column in the center. A bronze basin 0.40 m. dia. with a miniature bronze lion fitted with a water jet was found on the right side of the peristyle, with the feet of the basin welded in the form of a ring. This was also the area where a fragment of the head of a statuette was found, and a marble monopodium was discovered nearby. Along the edge of the eastern half of the garden seven enormous dolia were embedded in the soil.

Keywords porticoes peristyle tablina triclinium exedra puteals atrium impluvia Garden Description Eighteen partially fluted columns supported the large portico (a) surrounding this spacious peristyle garden. Excavated in 1861, the garden was located at the rear of the tablinum and could be viewed from the large triclinium on the east or the exedra on the west. A wooden fence had enclosed the garden as evidenced by the vertical slots in the columns where the fence had been secured. The portico held two puteals, one marble and the other travertine. A gutter circled the garden and at the south end a pool 0.90 x 1.05 m.; 0.18 m. deep contained a fountain. There was also a fountain located in the atrium, which became a common house feature after the completion of the aquaduct. At the edge of the marble impluvium two ornate trapezophori flanked a round opening containing the bronze water key that controlled the water jet in the center of the impluvium.

Keywords porticoes exedra triclinium Garden Description The earthquake most likely was the reason the corner columns were reinforced by pillars on this portico which originally had an upper gallery or loggia. This portico surrounded an elegant garden (a) which was excavated in 1861. The northeast corner had a wall between the columns; the rest of the columns were connected by a wooden fence. Fig. 10, 8.17.78 A water jet in the center of the garden spouted from a round marble table on a column into a pool 1.40 x 1.55 m.; 1.35 m. deep. The pool had eight iron hooks which Fiorelli suggested were for securing food items that could be kept cool by the flowing water and the shade provided by surrounding trees and shrubs. A marble monopodium was found in the northwest corner of the garden amidst the plantings. Visible across the length of the garden from the street entrance was the marble fountain statuette of a boy with a duck under his arm holding a vase in his right hand from which water cascaded down marble water steps into a channel. A channel around the perimeter of the garden caught the water that sprung from bronze pipes concealed in the columns at a height of about 1.25 m. from ground level. An excellent view of the garden could be enjoyed from the rooms on each side including the large exedra on the south, and on the southeast, the wide portico could have been used as a summer triclinium. The graffiti in this house included a notation of the purchase of sale of 200 lbs. of hog’s lard and 250 bunches of garlic in July: IIX ID IVLIAS AXVNGIA P CC/ ALIV (m) MANVPLOS CCL (CIL IV. 2070) scratched on the right wall. The corner pillar of the portico counseled: MORAM SI QVARES / SPARGE MILIV (m) ET COL/ LIGE (CIL IV. 2069), if you want to waste time, scatter millet and then pick it up.

Keywords tablina Garden Description What was formerly a garden with a pool was converted into a large open area (a) by the demolition of some walls to the rear of the tablinium. Significant remnants of woolen and linen cloth were recovered from the area when it was excavated in 1860-1861 and this led Fiorelli to believe that the Stabian Baths just across the street used this area to wash clothes and dry them in the open.
