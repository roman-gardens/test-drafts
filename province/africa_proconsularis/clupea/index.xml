Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Aspis/Clupea (Kelibia)
Aspis/Clupea (Pleiades)
Location Description The city was built along the slope of the hill several kilometers northwest of the present town. Excavations revealed the Capitol and an important residential district descending in successive levels towards the bank.
Garden House of the Bust of Marcus Aurelius (Maison du Buste de Marc Aurèle)
Keywords domus peristyle houses aedicules semicircular basin Marcus Aurelius sculpture Garden Description This domus (ca. 1000 m²) has a large central garden of irregular shape (250 m²) enclosed by a peristyle (20.20 x 21.40 m, 432.30 m²) (Plan view, Fig. 1). The northwest wing seems the most important area of the house. It had a large corridor XVII that opened onto a portico XVIII with a view toward the garden. In the garden, along the axis of the main reception room II, a semi-circular aedicula XXIV was installed on a cistern XXVI where fragments of Marcus Aurelius bust were found that was probably installed on a stuccoed statue base XXV. On the south side of the garden on the edge of the gallery XXI was a semi-circular pool XXVIII.
The wing that is perpendicular to the northwest one was comprised of a series of rooms built against the hill. All rooms were paved with mosaics and belonged to a latter phase. Rooms located on the higher level beyond this wing had a large panoramic view of the sea.
Built over an older establishment, the house presents two main phases. The main building dates from the 3rd quarter of the IInd century, with mosaic decoration from Severian times.

Garden House of the Two Hunts (Maison aux deux chasses)
Keywords domus peristyle houses semicircular basin oeci Garden Description Known for its beautiful hunting scene mosaics, this large domus (1100m²) was laid out around a square shaped peristyle-garden (15.50x15m) (Plan view, Fig. 1). The low wall of four porticos enclosed the viridarium, which curves to form an apse in front of the oecus. The house was constructed on the remains of an old salt factory; the three basins located on the east side of the garden are the remains of the previous phase of the building.
The house is dated to the 5th-6th century AD on the base of the style of its mosaics, however stratigraphical and archaeological evidence shows previous building phases and supplies a terminus post quem to the second half of the 2nd century - first half of the 3rd century.
