&lt;p>The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 B.C. when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 B.C. Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century A.D. Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (&lt;em>Athenaeus Deip.&lt;/em> XV.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> is particularly well-attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary &lt;em>topos&lt;/em>, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (&lt;em>Deipnosophistae&lt;/em> 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century A.D. that&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all…&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (&lt;em>Sycamorus orientalis&lt;/em>) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Pliny HN 12.9).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, &lt;em>paira daeza&lt;/em>, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, &lt;em>De Senectute&lt;/em>. 17.59. These &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud &lt;em>Plut. Cim.&lt;/em> 10; comp. Cic. &lt;em>de Off.&lt;/em> 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See &lt;em>Anabasis&lt;/em> 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and &lt;em>Oeconomicus&lt;/em> 4.13). Xenophon also describes how &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C. Notable examples of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, the &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em>, the &lt;em>alsos&lt;/em>, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century B.C., however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public
Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for this essay indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few—primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards—often the most manageable to investigate - are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (see below). This catalog includes areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, and notes sites where the excavators have some level of optimism about fruitful future study. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor awaits archaeological investigation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The most striking remains are in Terrace House 2, in Room 20 (Residence 4), excavated by H. Vetters between 1967-1983. Here, in a space originally designed as a courtyard, the walls are decorated with an elaborate garden scene. Much of the painting is covered by a later painting of marble panels, but on the north and west walls the garden scene has been partially revealed (Figs. 1 and 2). The viewer within the room looks out past a real marble dado on top of which is an illusionistic marble fence with an unusual egg and dart design along the top. Beyond is a garden scene, similar to those seen in Pompeii or the famous garden scene of Livia at Prima Porta. The scene is filled with luxuriant foliage, out of which apple trees rise up against the blue sky bearing apples or quinces. A bird flies over a young juniper or cypress. The illusion of the garden continues without a break around the corners. It allows the viewers to feel present in a garden, while knowing they are in a room looking out at it. The later painting completely destroys both the illusion and any recollection that the space had formerly been an open courtyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the central peristyle of Residence 2 of Terrace House 2, Vetters uncovered a late Imperial mosaic of Dionysius and Ariadne in a niche. The peristyle itself is a paved courtyard, but the mosaic offers the viewer a rich view of a paradisiacal vineyard. A lunette features a mosaic of two peacocks holding a garland over a basket or urn of grapes and fruits, with white geese to each side standing on a green lawn with roses and lilies (Fig. 3). The ceiling of the niche features Dionysias and Ariadne in a central medallion set into a panel of blue, against which is arrayed a vine laden with grapes and doves (Fig. 4). In the upper corner, the vine emerges from the ground, and along the base of the wall, a winged &lt;em>putto&lt;/em> leads two harnessed leopards or panthers. The opposite side is not preserved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just off the peristyle in Room 17, the walls feature a variety of birds, individually portrayed on white backgrounds either sitting on branches or standing among small plants. In Room 24, the landscape themes continue with a painting of stags in woodland, apparently being chased by a putto. Only a small fragment remains. In Room 14, mythological scenes of Achilles and Skyros (west wall) and Achilles and Priam (south wall) are set in a landscape of rocks and trees (Fig. 6). Bird and plant themes are represented through this house.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>According to a secondary inscription carved horizontally, perhaps in the third century A.D., across the back of a figured grave stele of perhaps the third or second century B.C., found on the road between the Magnesia gate and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, “this orchard with its sarcophagi and pavilion (?yÒlow) belongs to Aphrodisios and his wife and children” (toËto tÚ pvmãrin §st‹n sÁn tew svro›w k¢ t“ yÒlƒ ÉAfrodis¤ou k¢ g(u)n(aikÚw) Flab€aw k¢ t°knv[n]). The first editor, Hicks, interpreted the word pvmãrin to mean “cover” or “lid” (p«ma) and thought that the stele originally protected the entrance to the monument, but Keil (who corrected the misreading §vro›wto svro›w[for soro›w], “sarcophagi”), rightly saw that pvmãrin was nothing more than a transliterated form of the Latin pomarium, fruit orchard, an amenity often attached to tomb monuments in the Roman world. The character of the yÒlow is uncertain—the term is attested only once elsewhere in Asia Minor in a funerary context, in Pisidia, where a yÒlow is equipped with statues (Monumenta Asiae Minoris Antiquae. Manchester and London, 1928-1993, VIII, 375; cf. Kubin’ska)—but the transliterated pumarin gives reason to suspect that a Roman context is here relevant, in which case one naturally thinks of the sort of ornamental (often round) pavilion (diaeta) frequently found in Roman tomb gardens.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="province-description">Province Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 BCE, when king &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attalus_III">Attalos III&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550812">Pergamum&lt;/a> bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 BCE &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/errata/1001906">Asia&lt;/a> was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/599612">Ephesos&lt;/a>, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian">Diocletian&lt;/a> (284-305 CE) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century CE Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638917">Kibyra&lt;/a>, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus-grc2:15.41">(Ath. &lt;em>Deip.&lt;/em> 15.690)&lt;/a>. Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> is particularly well attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary &lt;em>topos&lt;/em>, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeus">Athenaeus&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus-eng1:12.11">(&lt;em>Deip.&lt;/em> 12.515d-f)&lt;/a> wrote in the second century CE that&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all...&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny the Elder&lt;/a> writes of an ancient plane tree (&lt;em>Sycamorus orientalis&lt;/em>) in &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638965">Lycia&lt;/a> with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:12.5">(Plin. &lt;em>HN&lt;/em> 12.5)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of &lt;em>horti&lt;/em> and gardens of Rome. The &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em>, from the Persian, &lt;em>paira daeza&lt;/em>, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas. It was at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550867">Sardis&lt;/a> that the Greek &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander">Lysander&lt;/a> visited &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Younger">Cyrus the Younger&lt;/a>, a visit recorded by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearchus_of_Soli">Klearchos&lt;/a> and retold by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon">Xenophon&lt;/a>. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero">Cicero&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi051.perseus-lat1:59">(&lt;em>Sen.&lt;/em> 59)&lt;/a>. These &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimon">Kimon&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotole&lt;/a> &lt;em>apud&lt;/em> &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg035.perseus-grc1:10">Plut. &lt;em>Cim.&lt;/em> 10&lt;/a>; cf. &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi055.perseus-lat1:2.64">Cic. &lt;em>de Off.&lt;/em> 2.64&lt;/a>), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/511225">Daskyleion&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638751">Celenae&lt;/a> are also vividly described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon">Xenophon&lt;/a> (see &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg006.perseus-grc1:1.2.7">&lt;em>An.&lt;/em> 1.2.7&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="(http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg006.perseus-grc1:2.4.14)">2.4.14&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg003.perseus-grc1:4.13">&lt;em>Oec.&lt;/em> 4.13&lt;/a>). Xenophon also describes how &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BCE. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator">Seleucus of Syria&lt;/a> took over the royal &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550867">Sardis&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg057.perseus-grc1:50">Plut. &lt;em>Dem.&lt;/em> 50&lt;/a>). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> in Asia in the second and first centuries BCE. Notable examples of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/461581651">Mausoleum&lt;/a> at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/599636">Halicarnassus&lt;/a> is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, the &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em>, the &lt;em>alsos&lt;/em>, the &lt;em>gymnasium&lt;/em>, and the &lt;em>quadriporticus&lt;/em> are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century BCE, however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving &lt;em>quadriporticus&lt;/em> form for display to the public&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for the gardens of this region indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few — primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards — often the most manageable to investigate — are paved. The larger &lt;em>palaestrae&lt;/em>, &lt;em>gymnasia&lt;/em>, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638753">Aphrodisias&lt;/a> is setting an important precedent (&lt;a href="">CROSS-REF&lt;/a>). The gardens included in this province include areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, as well as sites where the excavators have some level of optimism that future study may yet reveal more about gardens. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor remains in its archaeological infancy.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="location-description">Location Description&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Pergamum, a fortress site in Mysia near the Aegean coast, was transformed into an architectural center under the Attalid dynasty (282-133 B.C.). Attalus the III wrote treatises on gardens, raised poisonous plants, made wax models (Plut. Demet. 20.2), and upon his death, left the kingdom of Mysia to the Romans. It became one of the most important Roman cities of Asia, and current scholarship has revealed its significance as an influence on the art and architecture of Rome. The range of designed open spaces includes sanctuaries, gymnasia, palaestra, and agoras, all of which were renovated during the Roman period. No archaeological remains of planting features have been reported, but an inscription records a law prohibiting the deliberate planting of trees near walls (SEG XIII 521.11.158-61).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, &lt;em>paira daeza&lt;/em>, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, &lt;em>De Senectute&lt;/em>. 17.59. These &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud &lt;em>Plut. Cim.&lt;/em> 10; comp. Cic. &lt;em>de Off.&lt;/em> 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See &lt;em>Anabasis&lt;/em> 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and &lt;em>Oeconomicus&lt;/em> 4.13). Xenophon also describes how &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C. Notable examples of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.&lt;/p>

This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

&lt;p>The &lt;em>sanctuary&lt;/em> of Apollo at Didyma was a regional sanctuary that lay on the border of Caria and Ionia (Strabo 12.1.2). The Temple of Apollo, attested by Strabo (12.1.5), was built on the site of the spring and oracle of Apollo mentioned by Herodotus (1.92.159) and Pausanius (7.2.6). Inscriptions found in the area of the sanctuary attest to a “&lt;em>sacred grove&lt;/em>” [(CIG 2885d)] and Strabo (14.1.5) specifies that in his day a grove (&lt;em>alsos&lt;/em>) was planted inside and outside the temple precinct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The precinct has been well-defined archaeologically, but the archaeologists identified no traces of the trees.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://roman-gardens.github.io/test-drafts/province/">Asia&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="province-description">Province Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 BCE, when king &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attalus_III">Attalos III&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550812">Pergamum&lt;/a> bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 BCE &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/errata/1001906">Asia&lt;/a> was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/599612">Ephesos&lt;/a>, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian">Diocletian&lt;/a> (284-305 CE) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century CE Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638917">Kibyra&lt;/a>, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus-grc2:15.41">(Ath. &lt;em>Deip.&lt;/em> 15.690)&lt;/a>. Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> is particularly well attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary &lt;em>topos&lt;/em>, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeus">Athenaeus&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus-eng1:12.11">(&lt;em>Deip.&lt;/em> 12.515d-f)&lt;/a> wrote in the second century CE that&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all...&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny the Elder&lt;/a> writes of an ancient plane tree (&lt;em>Sycamorus orientalis&lt;/em>) in &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638965">Lycia&lt;/a> with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:12.5">(Plin. &lt;em>HN&lt;/em> 12.5)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of &lt;em>horti&lt;/em> and gardens of Rome. The &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em>, from the Persian, &lt;em>paira daeza&lt;/em>, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas. It was at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550867">Sardis&lt;/a> that the Greek &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander">Lysander&lt;/a> visited &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Younger">Cyrus the Younger&lt;/a>, a visit recorded by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearchus_of_Soli">Klearchos&lt;/a> and retold by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon">Xenophon&lt;/a>. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero">Cicero&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi051.perseus-lat1:59">(&lt;em>Sen.&lt;/em> 59)&lt;/a>. These &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimon">Kimon&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotole&lt;/a> &lt;em>apud&lt;/em> &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg035.perseus-grc1:10">Plut. &lt;em>Cim.&lt;/em> 10&lt;/a>; cf. &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi055.perseus-lat1:2.64">Cic. &lt;em>de Off.&lt;/em> 2.64&lt;/a>), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/511225">Daskyleion&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638751">Celenae&lt;/a> are also vividly described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon">Xenophon&lt;/a> (see &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg006.perseus-grc1:1.2.7">&lt;em>An.&lt;/em> 1.2.7&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="(http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg006.perseus-grc1:2.4.14)">2.4.14&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg003.perseus-grc1:4.13">&lt;em>Oec.&lt;/em> 4.13&lt;/a>). Xenophon also describes how &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BCE. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator">Seleucus of Syria&lt;/a> took over the royal &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550867">Sardis&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg057.perseus-grc1:50">Plut. &lt;em>Dem.&lt;/em> 50&lt;/a>). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> in Asia in the second and first centuries BCE. Notable examples of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/461581651">Mausoleum&lt;/a> at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/599636">Halicarnassus&lt;/a> is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, the &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em>, the &lt;em>alsos&lt;/em>, the &lt;em>gymnasium&lt;/em>, and the &lt;em>quadriporticus&lt;/em> are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century BCE, however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving &lt;em>quadriporticus&lt;/em> form for display to the public&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for the gardens of this region indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few — primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards — often the most manageable to investigate — are paved. The larger &lt;em>palaestrae&lt;/em>, &lt;em>gymnasia&lt;/em>, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638753">Aphrodisias&lt;/a> is setting an important precedent (&lt;a href="">CROSS-REF&lt;/a>). The gardens included in this province include areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, as well as sites where the excavators have some level of optimism that future study may yet reveal more about gardens. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor remains in its archaeological infancy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A large stele of light grey marble inscribed on both sides and found in 1965 lying in a field between Akhisar (&lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550924">Thyateira&lt;/a>) and Kirkağuç (&lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550767">Nakrason&lt;/a>) in the border land between &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550701">Lydia&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550759">Mysia&lt;/a> records the final part (perhaps second half) of the will of a certain Epikrates, the son of Epikrates, from &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550924">Thyateira&lt;/a>, establishing a foundation to provide commemorative funerary rites for his son Diophantos, also from Thyateira. The detailed provisions of the will, which include specific topographical indications for the disposition of various productive properties to support the foundation, reveal a network of watercourses, vineyards, olive groves, cultivated fields, and open land in which a funerary grove (&lt;em>alsos&lt;/em>) is set aside for Diophantos and another exception is made for “the garden in which my mother Tertia and my maternal uncle Secundus are buried” (κήπου, ἐν ᾦ τέθαπται Τερτία μου ἡ μήτηρ καὶ ὁ πρὸς μητρὸς θεῖος Σεκοῦνδος, lines 90-91). Two of the nearby properties are identified with toponyms, the “Elm Grove” (Πτελεών, lines 16, 18, 30) and the “Brickworks” (Πλινθούλκιον, line 28), which suggest productive areas comprising woodlands and claybeds as well as cultivated plots. The funerary complex described by Epikrates included buildings (οἰκοδομήματα, line 47), surrounding walls (περικείμενοι τοῖχοι, line 47), and the tomb of Diophantos, destined eventually to house the remains also of Epikrates and other members of his family (lines 76-79). The male line of the clan (Epikrates, Epikrates, and Diophantos) proclaimed its Greek ethnicity in its nomenclature, but the women of the family—his mother Tertia (sister of Secundus), his wife Laevilla, his daughter Tertia, and his granddaughter Cestia—all bore Roman names. Such mixed marriages of local male élites and women from the families of the Roman governing class (or, eventually, simply bearing Roman names) are characteristic of the provincial aristocracy of Asia Minor during the first century, the period to which, on the basis of its vocabulary and lettering, the inscribed testament of Epikrates belongs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus-grc2:15.41">(Ath. &lt;em>Deip.&lt;/em> 15.690)&lt;/a>. Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> is particularly well attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary &lt;em>topos&lt;/em>, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeus">Athenaeus&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001.perseus-eng1:12.11">(&lt;em>Deip.&lt;/em> 12.515d-f)&lt;/a> wrote in the second century CE that&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all...&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny the Elder&lt;/a> writes of an ancient plane tree (&lt;em>Sycamorus orientalis&lt;/em>) in &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638965">Lycia&lt;/a> with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:12.5">(Plin. &lt;em>HN&lt;/em> 12.5)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of &lt;em>horti&lt;/em> and gardens of Rome. The &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em>, from the Persian, &lt;em>paira daeza&lt;/em>, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas. It was at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550867">Sardis&lt;/a> that the Greek &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander">Lysander&lt;/a> visited &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Younger">Cyrus the Younger&lt;/a>, a visit recorded by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearchus_of_Soli">Klearchos&lt;/a> and retold by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon">Xenophon&lt;/a>. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero">Cicero&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi051.perseus-lat1:59">(&lt;em>Sen.&lt;/em> 59)&lt;/a>. These &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimon">Kimon&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotole&lt;/a> &lt;em>apud&lt;/em> &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg035.perseus-grc1:10">Plut. &lt;em>Cim.&lt;/em> 10&lt;/a>; cf. &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi055.perseus-lat1:2.64">Cic. &lt;em>de Off.&lt;/em> 2.64&lt;/a>), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/511225">Daskyleion&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638751">Celenae&lt;/a> are also vividly described by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon">Xenophon&lt;/a> (see &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg006.perseus-grc1:1.2.7">&lt;em>An.&lt;/em> 1.2.7&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="(http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg006.perseus-grc1:2.4.14)">2.4.14&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg003.perseus-grc1:4.13">&lt;em>Oec.&lt;/em> 4.13&lt;/a>). Xenophon also describes how &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BCE. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator">Seleucus of Syria&lt;/a> took over the royal &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550867">Sardis&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg057.perseus-grc1:50">Plut. &lt;em>Dem.&lt;/em> 50&lt;/a>). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> in Asia in the second and first centuries BCE. Notable examples of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/461581651">Mausoleum&lt;/a> at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/599636">Halicarnassus&lt;/a> is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, the &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em>, the &lt;em>alsos&lt;/em>, the &lt;em>gymnasium&lt;/em>, and the &lt;em>quadriporticus&lt;/em> are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century BCE, however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving &lt;em>quadriporticus&lt;/em> form for display to the public&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for the gardens of this region indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few — primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards — often the most manageable to investigate — are paved. The larger &lt;em>palaestrae&lt;/em>, &lt;em>gymnasia&lt;/em>, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at &lt;a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/638753">Aphrodisias&lt;/a> is setting an important precedent (&lt;a href="">CROSS-REF&lt;/a>). The gardens included in this province include areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, as well as sites where the excavators have some level of optimism that future study may yet reveal more about gardens. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor remains in its archaeological infancy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Inscriptions of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. record certain regulations for the maintenance of a sacred grove belonging to Asklepios on the island of Kos. Cypress trees are specifically mentioned, and it was unlawful to cut them down or remove wood from the sanctuary. In the mid-first century B.C., however, a Roman prefect by the name of Turullius felled trees in the sanctuary to acquire timber for building ships. Caesar had him executed for this offence (Cassius Dio 51.8.3; Valerius Maximus 1.1.19).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 B.C. when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 B.C. Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century A.D. Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (&lt;em>Athenaeus Deip.&lt;/em> XV.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> is particularly well-attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary &lt;em>topos&lt;/em>, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (&lt;em>Deipnosophistae&lt;/em> 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century A.D. that&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, &lt;em>paira daeza&lt;/em>, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, &lt;em>De Senectute&lt;/em>. 17.59. These &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud &lt;em>Plut. Cim.&lt;/em> 10; comp. Cic. &lt;em>de Off.&lt;/em> 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See &lt;em>Anabasis&lt;/em> 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and &lt;em>Oeconomicus&lt;/em> 4.13). Xenophon also describes how &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C.

Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century A.D. Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (&lt;em>Athenaeus Deip.&lt;/em> XV.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> is particularly well-attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary &lt;em>topos&lt;/em>, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (&lt;em>Deipnosophistae&lt;/em> 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century A.D. that&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all…&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (&lt;em>Sycamorus orientalis&lt;/em>) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Pliny HN 12.9).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, &lt;em>paira daeza&lt;/em>, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, &lt;em>De Senectute&lt;/em>. 17.59. These &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud &lt;em>Plut. Cim.&lt;/em> 10; comp. Cic. &lt;em>de Off.&lt;/em> 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See &lt;em>Anabasis&lt;/em> 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and &lt;em>Oeconomicus&lt;/em> 4.13). Xenophon also describes how &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C. Notable examples of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, the &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em>, the &lt;em>alsos&lt;/em>, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century B.C., however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public
Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for this essay indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few—primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards—often the most manageable to investigate - are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (see below). This catalog includes areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, and notes sites where the excavators have some level of optimism about fruitful future study. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor awaits archaeological investigation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A broken inscription found near Thyaira in 1901 records the second part of a funerary dedication in which the dedicant prescribes who can be buried in his monument and forbids anyone “to sell this tomb or the garden (peribÒlion) in front of it with the crematory in it oÈk §j°stai d¢ oÈden[‹] pvl∞sai toËto tÚ ≤r“on oÈd¢ tÚ prÚ aÈtoË peribÒlion §n ⁄ §stin ≤kaÊstra)”. The prohibition against alienation suggests that &lt;em>peribÒlion&lt;/em> here, like &lt;em>peribÒlow&lt;/em> at Attaleia and Hypaipa in Lydia and often elsewhere, refers metonymically to a garden enclosed within the wall rather than simply to the wall itself. The crematory (≤kaÊstra)—a feature seldom mentioned in funerary inscriptions in Asia Minor—suggests a Roman style tomb garden, with &lt;em>ustrina&lt;/em>	and tomb monument enclosed within the same perimeter wall, as often around Rome and on the Bay of Naples.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 B.C. when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 B.C.

&lt;p>A statue base found in 1886 in a modern cemetery midway along the path between Gueuktché-Ahmed and Seldjikli preserves, on its front, a decree of the local senate and people at Attaleia passed, probably, some time during the second century honoring Bassus and his father Euarestos for their demonstration of piety toward the guardian Zeus of the city; on its right side, an excerpt from Euarestos’s will instructing his heir to provide oil to the community on one day a year annually; and, on its left side, detailed instructions for the implementation of the foundation: “From the first to the fifth hour of the day the oil shall be provided from the revenues of the garden (per™€bolow) purchased from Eubolos, the son of Antiphanes, for Bassos, son of Euarestos, grandson of Phocas”. (épÚ Àraw a' ßvw e' t`eyÆsetai tÚ ¶leon §k prosÒd&lt;o>vn peribÒlou toË égorasy°ntow parå EÈboÊlou ÉAntifãnouw efiw Bãsson EÈar°[s]tou Fvkç tÚn ÍÒn). The location of the garden in relation to Bassos’s tomb is not specified, and the statue base recording its purchase and the honorific decree recognizing it were probably set up in a public place rather than at the tomb, but the commemorative purpose of the garden in supporting an annual distribution in his name is clear, and it is likely that the two properties were near each other, if not contiguous. In accordance with an idiomatic usage common in both Greek and Latin and favored in Lydia (as at Hypaipa and Thyaira), the garden is identified metonymically by reference to its enclosure wall (per™€bolow), the &lt;em>sine qua non&lt;/em> of a tomb garden in the Greco-Roman world.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;quot;The Lydians in their luxury planned parks and made them like gardens and so kept in the shade. For they thought it more dainty not to have the sun’s rays touch them at all…&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other districts of Asia captured the Roman imagination: Pliny the Elder writes of an ancient plane tree (&lt;em>Sycamorus orientalis&lt;/em>) in Lycia with a girth of sufficient circumference to house a grotto in its hollow trunk, ornamented with pumice and moss with provisions for 18 people to dine there (Pliny HN 12.9).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Persian satraps are of particular influence on the introduction of horti and gardens of Rome. The paradeisos, from the Persian, &lt;em>paira daeza&lt;/em>, or “enclosed place,” is a term that had evolved by the Hellenistic period to mean a large enclosed park with luxurious gardens as well as orchards, collections of trees, crops, and hunting areas (see Sardis below). It was at Sardis that the Greek Lysander visited Cyrus the Younger, a visit recorded by Clearchus and retold by Xenophon. It is an essential moment in garden history recounted for the Romans by Cicero, &lt;em>De Senectute&lt;/em>. 17.59. These &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in the sense of luxurious orchards, are said by the Romans to have been brought to Greece by Kimon (Aristot. apud &lt;em>Plut. Cim.&lt;/em> 10; comp. Cic. &lt;em>de Off.&lt;/em> 2.18Plutarch), and were adopted by Hellenistic kings throughout Greece and southern Italy during the late Hellenistic period. The hunting parks at Daskyleion and Celenae are also vividly described by Xenophon (See &lt;em>Anabasis&lt;/em> 1.2.7, 2.4.14 and &lt;em>Oeconomicus&lt;/em> 4.13). Xenophon also describes how &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> were occupied or cut down by armies during the fourth and third centuries BC. Appreciation for these parks apparently continued, and Seleucus of Syria took over the royal paradeisos at Sardis (Plutarch, Demetrios 50.6). Years of instability followed, so it is difficult to know what the Romans themselves thought of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> in Asia in the second and first centuries B.C. Notable examples of &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em>, in some form, may have been visible to Romans visiting Asia, as well. For example, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is now thought by its excavators to have been set in a grove or park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, the &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em>, the &lt;em>alsos&lt;/em>, the gymnasium, and the quadriporticus are not forms the Romans suddenly “discovered.” They had had a long influence and were integrated into the Hellenistic architectural forms of the Italic landscape. In the second century B.C., however, when the Roman generals began to define themselves as rulers of an empire, they turned directly to the palaces and &lt;em>paradeisoi&lt;/em> of the Hellenistic monarchs to establish their power, to display spoils of war, and to create the luxurious setting for life in Rome. They further adapted the evolving quadriporticus form for display to the public
Despite the importance of Asia Minor in the history of the Roman landscape, archaeological evidence is scant. The excavators contacted for this essay indicated that parks, gardens, and other planted areas have yet to become a subject of research design for the region and finds appear to be few—primarily inscriptions and wall paintings. Most of the smaller domestic courtyards—often the most manageable to investigate - are paved. The larger palaestrae, gymnasia, and enclosed open spaces have not been investigated for landscape architectural and planting features, although recently an important campaign of work in the South Agora at Aphrodisias is setting an important precedent (see below). This catalog includes areas with dirt and incomplete paved surfaces, and notes sites where the excavators have some level of optimism about fruitful future study. The subject of designed landscapes, gardens, and planted areas in Asia Minor awaits archaeological investigation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The region of what is now modern Turkey became a part of the Roman Empire in 133 B.C. when king Attalos III of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people. The province included the heartland of the Pergamene kingdom as well as the territories of Mysia, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, western Phrygia and the eastern Aegean islands. Under Augustus in 27 B.C. Asia was declared a senatorial province and the governance of a proconsul. The capital of the province was Ephesos, although Pergamon may have fulfilled this role initially. Under Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) the province was subdivided into smaller administrative units: Hellespontus, Asia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia I and Phrygia II. Due to its excellent harbors on the west coast and its many navigable rivers, Asia’s water-borne trade with the rest of the Mediterranean flourished. In the second century A.D. Asia experienced great prosperity, to which the growth and architectural aggrandizement of many of its cities attest. In the area of Kibyra, bordering the regions of Lycia, Caria, Phrygia and Pisidia, numerous inscriptions refer to the large imperial estates of Roman families. Woolen textiles, marble, and timber constituted a significant part of the commodities exported from the province.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Romans might have looked to the Greeks for inspiration in philosophy, architecture, sculpture, and the fine arts, the non-Greek peoples of the eastern Mediterranean are their inspiration for luxury, fine-living, and the status conferred by displays of individual wealth (&lt;em>Athenaeus Deip.&lt;/em> XV.690). Asia was a center for such splendor, first in the kingdoms of Lydia, Phrygia, and Lycia, and then continued by the Persian satraps, and later the Hellenistic kings. The Persian &lt;em>paradeisos&lt;/em> is particularly well-attested in literature referencing Asia. That these gardens are known primarily from Roman-period literary sources indicates their continuing influence. For example, long after the gold of Lydia’s Pactolus River had disappeared, Lydia remained a literary &lt;em>topos&lt;/em>, not only for copious wealth, but for a life of luxury set in a landscape of natural abundance. Athenaeus (&lt;em>Deipnosophistae&lt;/em> 12.515d-f) wrote in the second century A.D. that&lt;/p>

&lt;p>An inscription (MAMA VIII, 448) indicates that Artemidorus Pedias, during his term as &lt;em>strategos&lt;/em>, promised to “adorn a palm grove with a statue of Hermes, and a gilded Aphrodite with Erotes holding lamps on either side and a marble Eros in Front” (Roueché, 70.) The location of this garden is not specified. Robert suggests, based on the location of the inscription, that it was in the temenos of Aphrodite (Robert, 257). Roueché conjectures that it perhaps lay on the east side of the agora, based upon the presence of Hermes Agoraios (MAMA VIII, 406, 445, 446, and CIG 2770). She proposes that the grove was later embellished by the fountain at the agora gate, where inscriptions (Hell. IV, 131-2) honor the conversion of the gate into a fountain, alluding to the &lt;em>Nymphs&lt;/em> of the “place of the palms” (RRR Smith et al. 2018) Roueché notes that this palm-grove, with its walks, statuary, and fountains was clearly an elaborately decorated park. The agora and &lt;em>temenos&lt;/em> have been identified. The south agora (215 x 70m) features a long, monumental basin in its center.&lt;/p>
